@top AUC @TeX{}
 
AUC @TeX{} is an integrated environment for editing La@TeX{} and
@TeX{} files.@refill

This file documents AUC @TeX{} version 8.0.

The keybindings have changed since 6.1, @pxref{Version 7.0} for details.

Although AUC @TeX{} contains a large number of features, there are no
reasons to despair.  You can continue to write @TeX{} and La@TeX{}
documents the way you are used to, and only start using the multiple
features in small steps.  AUC @TeX{} is not monolithic, each feature
described in this manual is useful by itself, but together they provide
an environment where you will make very few LaTeX errors, and makes it
easy to find the errors that may slip through anyway.

NOTE: This documentation is preliminary.  It should however cover most
important points.  Corrections or perhaps rewrites of sections
are VERY WELCOME.@refill

@node Introduction, Frequently Used Commands, Copying, top
@unnumbered Introduction 

AUC @TeX{} is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for LaTeX using GNU Emacs.
 
AUC @TeX{} lets you run @TeX{}/LaTeX and other LaTeX-related tools, such as
output filters or post processors from inside Emacs.  Especially
`running LaTeX' is interesting, as AUC @TeX{} lets you browse through
the errors @TeX{} reported, while it moves the cursor directly to the
reported error, and displays some documentation for that particular
error.  This will even work when the document is spread over several
files.
 
AUC @TeX{} automatically indents your `LaTeX-source', not only as you
write it---you can also let it indent and format an entire document.  It
supports the standard outline minor mode, which can greatly help you
`getting the overview' of a document.
 
Apart from these special features, AUC @TeX{} provides a large range of
handy Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write
your LaTeX documents fast and without pain.  Here's a short list of the
major features:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Insertion of templates for logical-structural compositions such as
environments and sections.

@item 
Hot-keys for easy access to certain often used constructs, e.g.,
font changes, accented letters, and mathematical symbols.

@item 
Running application programs (such as @TeX{}), and then parsing
the output so that errors in the document may be located 
easily.

@item 
Support for multi-file documents.

@item 
Online help for (La)@TeX{} error messages.

@item 
Outlining---i.e., manipulating the document as a composition
of nested/sequential logical constructs.

@item 
Instant formatting and indentation of the ASCII-document in
order to make it easier to read.

@item 
`Completion' (and thereby spell-checking) of partially written
control sequences.
@end itemize

@node Frequently Used Commands, Advanced Features, Introduction, top
@chapter Inserting Frequently Used Commands  

The most commonly used commands/macros of AUC @TeX{} are those which
simply insert templates for often used @TeX{} and/or La@TeX{}
constructs, like font changes, handling of environments, etc.
These features are very simple, and easy to learn, and help you
avoiding stupid mistakes like mismatched braces, or
@samp{\begin@{@}}-@samp{\end@{@}} pairs.@refill

@cindex Braces
@cindex Brackets
@cindex Dollars
@cindex Math mode delimiters
@cindex Matching dollar signs
@cindex Display math mode

In @TeX{} literal double quotes @samp{"like this"} are seldom used,
instead two single quotes are used @samp{``like this''}.  To help you
insert these efficiently, AUC @TeX{} allows you to continue to press
@kbd{"} to insert two single quotes.  To get a literal double quote,
press @kbd{"} twice.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-quote @var{count}
@kindex "
(@kbd{"}) Insert the appropriate quote marks for TeX.  

Inserts the value of @code{tex-open-quote} (normally @samp{``}) or
@code{tex-close-quote} (normally @samp{''}) depending on the context.
With prefix argument, always inserts @samp{"} characters.@refill
@end deffn

@defopt TeX-open-quote
String inserted by typing @kbd{"} to open a quotation.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-close-quote
String inserted by typing @kbd{"} to open a quotation.
@end defopt

If you include the style file @file{german} @code{TeX-open-quote} and
@code{TeX-close-quote} will both be set to @samp{"}.

In AUC @TeX{}, dollar signs should match like they do in @TeX{}.  This
has been parially implemented, we assume dollar signs always match
within a paragraph.  The first @samp{$} you insert in a paragraph will
do nothing special.  The second @samp{$} will match the first.  This
will be indicated by moving the cursor temporarily over the first dollar
sign.  If you enter a dollar sign that matches a double dollar sign
@samp{$$} AUC @TeX{} will automatically insert two dollar signs.  If you
enter a second dollar sign that matches a single dollar sign, the single
sollar sign will automatically be converted to a double dollar sign.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-dollar @var{arg}
@kindex $
(@kbd{$}) Insert dollar sign.  

Show matching dollar sign if this dollar sign end the @TeX{} math mode.  
Ensure double dollar signs match up correctly by inserting extra
dollar signs when needed.

With optional @var{arg}, insert that many dollar signs.
@end deffn

To avoid unbalanced braces, it is useful to insert them pairwise.  You
can do this by typing @kbd{C-c @{}.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-braces
@kindex C-c @{
(@kbd{C-c @{}) Make a pair of braces and position the cursor
to type inside of them.
@end deffn

@node Font Specifiers, Sectioning, Quotes, Frequently Used Commands
@section Inserting Font Specifiers 

@cindex Fonts
@cindex Font macros
@cindex Changing font
@cindex Specifying a font

Perhaps the most used keyboard commands of AUC @TeX{} are the short-cuts
available for easy insertion of font changing macros.  They all put the
font change inside a @TeX{} group, a practice that help preventing
subtle errors.  The most significant advantage of using these command
instead of typing it in yourself, is that the braces will always match
correctly.  

If you give an argument (that is, type @kbd{C-u}) to the font command,
the innermost font will be replaced, i.e. the font in the @TeX{} group
around point will be changed.  The following table shows the available
commands, with @code{@point{}} indicating the position where the text
will be inserted.@refill

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-f C-r 
@kindex C-c C-f C-r
@cindex @code{\rm}
Insert roman @r{@{\rm @point{}@}} text.

@item C-c C-f C-b
@kindex C-c C-f C-b
@cindex @code{\bf}
Insert @b{bold face} @samp{@{\bf @point{}@}} text.

@item C-c C-f C-i
@kindex C-c C-f C-i
@cindex @code{\it}
Insert @i{italics} @samp{@{\it @point{}\/@}} text.

@cindex @code{\sc}
Insert @sc{small caps} @samp{@{\sc @point{}@}} text.

@item C-c C-f C-d
@kindex C-c C-f C-c
@cindex Deleting fonts
Delete the innermost font specification containing point.

@end table

@deffn Command TeX-font @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-f
(@kbd{C-c C-f}) Insert template for font change command.

If @var{replace} is not nil, replace current font.  @var{what}
determines the font to use, as specified by @code{TeX-font-list}.
@end deffn

@defopt TeX-font-list
List of fonts used by TeX-font.

Each entry is a list with three elements.  The first element is the
key to activate the font.  The second element is the string to insert
before point, and the third element is the string to insert after
point.  An optional fourth element means always replace if not nil.

@cindex @code{\subsection}
@cindex @code{\label}

Insertion of sectioning macros, that is @samp{\chapter},
@samp{\section}, @samp{\subsection}, etc. and accompanying
@samp{\label}'s may be eased by using @kbd{C-c C-s}.  This command is
highly customizable, the following describes the default behavior.

When invoking you will be asked for a section macro to insert.  An
appropriate default is automatically selected by AUC @TeX{}, that is
either: at the top of the document; the top level sectioning for that
document style, and any other place: The same as the last occurring
sectioning command.

Next, you will be asked for the actual name of that section, and
last you will be asked for a label to be associated with that section.
The label will be prefixed by the value specified in
@code{LaTeX-section-hook}.

@deffn Command LaTeX-section @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-s
(@kbd{C-c C-s}) Insert a sectioning command.

Determine the type of section to be inserted, by the argument
@var{arg}.@refill

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @var{arg} is nil or missing, use the current level.
@item
If @var{arg} is a list (selected by C-u), go downward one level.
@item
If @var{arg} is negative, go up that many levels.
@item
If @var{arg} is positive or zero, use absolute level:
@itemize +
@item
0 : part
@item
1 : chapter
@item
2 : section
@item
3 : subsection
@item
4 : subsubsection
@item
5 : paragraph

6 : subparagraph
@end itemize
@end itemize

The following variables can be set to customize the function.

@vtable @code
@item LaTeX-section-hook
Hooks to be run when inserting a section.
@item LaTeX-section-label       
Prefix to all section references.
@end vtable

@end deffn

The precise behavior of @code{LaTeX-section} is defined by the contents
of @code{LaTeX-section-hook}.

@defopt LaTeX-section-hook
List of hooks to run when a new section is inserted.

The following variables are set before the hooks are run

@table @var
@item level
Numeric section level, default set by prefix arg to @code{LaTeX-section}.
@item name
Name of the sectioning command, derived from @var{level}.
@item title
The title of the section, default to an empty string.
@item toc
Entry for the table of contents list, default nil.  
@item done-mark
Position of point afterwards, default nil meaning after the inserted
text.
@end table

A number of hooks are already defined.  Most likely, you will be able to
get the desired functionality by choosing from these hooks.

@ftable @code
@item LaTeX-section-heading
Query the user about the name of the sectioning command.  Modifies
@var{level} and @var{name}.
@item LaTeX-section-title
Query the user about the title of the section. Modifies @var{title}.
@item LaTeX-section-toc
Query the user for the toc entry.  Modifies @var{toc}.
@item LaTeX-section-section
Insert La@TeX{} section command according to @var{name}, @var{title},
and @var{toc}.  If @var{toc} is nil, no toc entry is inserted.  If
@var{toc} or @var{title} are empty strings, @var{done-mark} will be
placed at the point they should be inserted.
@item LaTeX-section-label
Insert a label after the section command.  Controlled by the variable
@code{LaTeX-section-label}.
@end ftable 

To get a full featured @code{LaTeX-section} command, insert 

@lisp

@end lisp

in your @file{.emacs} file.
@end defopt

The behavior of @code{LaTeX-section-label} is determined by the
variable @code{LaTeX-section-label}.@refill

@defopt LaTeX-section-label
Default prefix when asking for a label.

If it is a string, it is used unchanged for all kinds of sections. 
If it is nil, no label is inserted.
If it is a list, the list is searched for a member whose car is equal
to the name of the sectioning command being inserted.  The cdr is then
used as the prefix.  If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil,
no label is inserted.

@cindex Prefix for labels
@cindex Label prefix
@cindex Labels
By default, chapters have a prefix of @samp{cha:} while sections and
subsections have a prefix of @samp{sec:}.  Labels are not automatically
inserted for other types of sections.

@node Environments,  , Sectioning, Frequently Used Commands
@section Inserting Environment Templates
@cindex Environments
@cindex @samp{\begin}
@cindex @samp{\end}

A large apparatus is available that supports insertions of environments,
that is @samp{\begin@{@}} --- @samp{\end@{@}} pairs.

AUC @TeX{} is aware of most of the actual environments available in a
specific document.  This is achieved by examining your
@samp{\documentstyle} command, and consulting a precompiled list of
environments available in a large number of styles.

You insert an environment with @kbd{C-c C-e}, and select an environment
type.  Depending on the environment, AUC @TeX{} may ask more questions
about the optional parts of the selected environment type.  With
@kbd{C-u C-c C-e} you will change the current environment.

@deffn Command LaTeX-environment @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-e
(@kbd{C-c C-e})  AUC @TeX{} will prompt you for an environment
to insert.  At this prompt, you may press @key{TAB} or @key{SPC} to
complete a partially written name, and/or to get a list of available
environments.  After selection of a specific environment AUC @TeX{} may
prompt you for further specifications.  

If the optional argument @var{arg} is not-nil (i.e. you have given a
prefix argument), the current environment is modified and no new
environment is inserted.
@end deffn

As a default selection, AUC @TeX{} will suggest the environment last
inserted or, as the first choice the value of the variable
@code{LaTeX-default-environment}.

@defopt LaTeX-default-environment
Default environment to insert when invoking @samp{LaTeX-environment}
first time.
@end defopt

If the document is empty, or the cursor is placed at the top of the
document, AUC @TeX{} will default to insert a `document' environment.

Most of these are described further in the following sections, and you
may easily specify more, as described in `Customizing environments'.

You can close the current environment with @kbd{C-c ]}, but we suggest
that you use @kbd{C-c C-e} to insert complete environments instead.

@deffn Command LaTeX-close-environment
@kindex C-c ]
(@kbd{C-c ]}) Insert an @samp{\end} that matches the current environment.

Figures and tables (i.e., floats) may also be inserted using AUC @TeX{}.
After choosing either `figure' or `table' in the environment list
described above, you will be prompted for a number of additional things.

@table @var
@item float-to
This field is the option of float environments that controls how they are
placed in the final document.  In La@TeX{} this is a sequence of the
letters @samp{htbp} as described in the La@TeX{} manual.  The value will
default to the value of @code{LaTeX-float}.
@vindex LaTeX-float

@item caption
This is the caption of the float.  

@item label
The label of this float.  The label will have a default prefix, which is

Moreover, in the case of a `figure' environment, you will be asked if
you want to insert a `center' environment inside the figure.

@defopt LaTeX-float

@end defopt

@defopt LaTeX-figure-label
Prefix to use for figure labels.

@deffn Command LaTeX-insert-item
@kindex C-c @key{LFD}
(@kbd{C-c @key{LFD}}) Close the current item, move to the next line and

@cindex Mathematics
@cindex Symbols
@cindex Abbreviations

@TeX{} is written by a mathematician, and has always contained good
support for formatting mathematical text.  AUC @TeX{} supports this
tradition, by offering a special minor mode for entering text with many
mathematic symbols.  You can enter this mode by typing @kbd{C-c
~}.@refill

@deffn Command LaTeX-math-mode
@kindex C-c ~
(@kbd{C-c ~}) Toggle LaTeX-math-mode.  This is a minor mode rebinding
the key @code{LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix} to allow easy typing of
mathematical symbols.  @kbd{`} will read a character from the keyboard,
and insert the symbol as specified in @code{LaTeX-math-list}.  If given a
prefix argument, the symbol will be surrounded by dollar signs.@refill
@end deffn

You can use another prefix key (instead of @kbd{`}) by  setting the
variable LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix.

@defopt LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix
A string containing the prefix of @code{LaTeX-math-mode} commands;
This value defaults to @kbd{`}. @refill
@end defopt

By default the symbol will be inserted using @code{TeX-insert-macro},
which normally means the symbol will be terminated by an empty set
braces. 

@defopt LaTeX-math-braces
Insert braces after LaTeX math symbols.

If this variable is nil, never insert braces.  If it is true, always
insert braces.  Otherwise, only insert braces if we can use the AUC
@TeX{} function @code{TeX-insert-macro} to do the job.
@end defopt

The variable @code{LaTeX-math-list} holds the actual mapping.

@defopt LaTeX-math-list
A list containing key command mappings to use in @code{LaTeX-math-mode}.
The car of each element is the key and the cdr is the macro name. 
@end defopt

The AUC @TeX{} distributions includes a reference card for
@code{LaTeX-math-mode} with a list of all math mode commands.

@node Completion, Commenting, Mathematics, Advanced Features
@section Completion 
@cindex Completion 
@cindex Expansion
@cindex Macro expansion
@cindex Macro completion
@cindex Macro arguments
@cindex Arguments to @TeX{} macros

Emacs lisp programmers probably know the @code{lisp-complete-symbol}
command, usually bound to @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}.  Users of the wonderful
ispell mode know and love the @code{ispell-complete-word} command from
that package.  Similarly, AUC @TeX{} has a @code{TeX-complete-symbol}
command, usually bound to @kbd{C-c @key{TAB}}.  Using
@code{LaTeX-complete-symbol} makes it easier to type and remember the
names of long La@TeX{} macros.
 
In order to use @code{TeX-complete-symbol}, you should write a backslash
and the start of the macro.  Typing @kbd{C-c @key{TAB}} will now
complete as much of the macro, as it unambiguously can.  For example, if
you type `@samp{\renewc}' and then `@kbd{C-c @key{TAB}}, it will expand
to `@samp{\renewcommand}'.
 
@deffn Command TeX-complete-symbol
@kindex C-c @key{TAB}
(@kbd{C-c @key{TAB}})  Complete @TeX{} symbol before point.
@end deffn

A more direct way to insert a macro is with @code{TeX-insert-macro},
bound to @kbd{C-c C-m}.  It has the advantage over completion that it
knows about the argument of most standard La@TeX{} macros, and will
prompt for them.  It also knows about the type of the arguments, so it
will for example give completion for the argument to @samp{\include}.
Some examples are listed below.

@deffn Command TeX-insert-macro
@kindex C-c C-m
(@kbd{C-c C-m}) Prompt (with completion) for the name of a @TeX{} macro,
and if AUC @TeX{} knows the macro, prompt for each argument.
@end deffn

As a default selection, AUC @TeX{} will suggest the macro last inserted
or, as the first choice the value of the variable
@code{TeX-default-macro}.

@defopt TeX-default-macro
Default macro to insert when invoking @code{TeX-insert-macro} first time.
@end defopt

A faster alternative is to bind the function @code{TeX-electric-macro}
to @samp{\}.  This can by setting the variable @code{TeX-electric-escape}

@defopt TeX-electric-escape
If this is non-nil when AUC @TeX{} is loaded, the @TeX{} escape
character @samp{\} will be bound to @code{TeX-electric-macro}
@end defopt

The difference between @code{TeX-insert-macro} and
@code{TeX-electric-macro} is that space will complete and exit from the
minibuffer in @code{TeX-electric-macro}.  Use @key{TAB} if you merely
want to complete.

@deffn Command TeX-electric-macro
Prompt (with completion) for the name of a @TeX{} macro,
and if AUC @TeX{} knows the macro, prompt for each argument.
Space will complete and exit.
@end deffn

Completions work because AUC @TeX{} can analyze @TeX{} files, and store
symbols in emacs lisp files for later retrieval.  @xref{Automatic}, for
more information.

@cindex \cite, completion of
@cindex Bib@TeX{}, completion
@cindex cite, completion of
@cindex bibliography, completion
@cindex citations, completion of
@cindex \label, completion
@cindex \ref, completion
@cindex labels, completion of
AUC @TeX{} will also make completion for many macro arguments, for
example existing labels when you enter a @samp{\ref} macro with
@code{TeX-insert-macro} or @code{TeX-electric-macro}, and Bib@TeX{}
entries when you enter a @samp{\cite} macro.  For this kind of
completion to work, parsing must be enabled as described in
@pxref{Parsing Files}.  For @samp{\cite} you must also make sure that
the Bib@TeX{} files can be found in @code{TeX-style-path} and have been
saved at least once after you enabled automatic parsing on save.

@node Commenting, Marking and formatting, Completion, Advanced Features
@section Commenting 

It is often necessary to comment out temporarily a region of @TeX{} or
La@TeX{} code.  This can be done with the commands @kbd{C-c ;} and
@kbd{C-c %}.  @kbd{C-c ;} will comment out all lines in the current
region, while @kbd{C-c %} will comment out the current paragraph.  To
uncomment, simply type @kbd{C-u C-c ;} to uncomment all lines in the
region, or @kbd{C-u C-c %} uncomment all comment lines around point.  

By default, these commands will insert or remove a single @samp{%}.  To
insert more than one, give an argument. @kbd{C-u 5 C-c %} will add five
@samp{%} to each line, while @kbd{C-u - 5 C-c %} will remove up to 5
@samp{%} from each line.

@deffn Command TeX-comment-region @var{count}
@kindex C-c ;
(@kbd{C-c ;}) Add or remove @samp{%} from the beginning of each line in
the current region, as specified by @var{count}.

If @var{count} is nil (no prefix argument), 1 @samp{%} will be added to
each line.

If @var{count} is a list (a non-numeric prefix argument), 1 @samp{%}
will be removed from each line.

If @var{count} is positive, @var{count} @samp{%}'s will be added to each
line. 

If @var{count} is negative, @var{count} @samp{%}'s will be removed from
each line.
@end deffn

@deffn Command TeX-comment-paragraph @var{count}
@kindex C-c %
(@kbd{C-c %}) Add or remove @samp{%} from the beginning of each line in
the current paragraph, as specified by @var{count}.  When removing
@samp{%}'s the paragraph is considered to consist of all preceding and
succeeding lines starting with a @samp{%}, until the first non-comment
line.

If @var{count} is nil (no prefix argument), 1 @samp{%} will be added to
each line.

If @var{count} is a list (a non-numeric prefix argument), 1 @samp{%}
will be removed from each line.

If @var{count} is positive, @var{count} @samp{%}'s will be added to each
line. 

If @var{count} is negative, @var{count} @samp{%}'s will be removed from

@cindex Reindenting

AUC @TeX{} contains very advanced handling of indentation and
reformatting of the La@TeX{} source.  If you have already tried AUC
@TeX{} with @code{auto-fill-mode} enabled, you may have noted that the
source is automatically indented and formatted as you write it.  More
over, AUC @TeX{} is able to format sections of text on demand.

It is important to realize, that AUC @TeX{} comes with `formatting' in
two fashions.  Either letting @TeX{} format the file, or letting AUC
@TeX{} make the ASCII document look better.

Indentation is done by La@TeX{} environments and by @TeX{} groups, that
is the body of an environment is indented by the value of
@code{LaTeX-indent-level} (default 2).  Also, items of an `itemize-like'
environment are indented by the value of @code{LaTeX-item-indent},
default @minus{}2.  This indentation makes it easier to see the
structure of the document, and to catch errors such as a missing close
brace.  Thus, the indentation is done for precisely the same reasons
that you would indent ordinary computer programs.
@vindex LaTeX-indent-level
@vindex LaTeX-item-indent

The following is a short sample of an itemize environment indented by
AUC @TeX{}.  If more environment are nested, they are indented
`accumulated' just like most programming languages usually are seen
indented in nested constructs.

@example
\begin@{itemize@}
\item Insertion of templates for logical-structural compositions such as
  environments and sections.
\item Hot-keys for easy access to certain often used constructs, e.g.,
  font changes, accented letters, and mathematical symbols.
\item Running application programs (such as \TeX), and then parsing
  the output so that errors in the document may be located 
  easily.
\item Support for multi-file documents.
\item Online help for \AllTeX\ error messages.
\item Outlining\Dash i.e., manipulating the document as a composition
  of nested/sequential logical constructs.
\item Instant formatting and indentation of the \ascii-document in
  order to make it easier to read.
\item `Completion' (and thereby spell-checking) of partially written
  control sequences.
\end@{itemize@}
@end example

You can format and indent single lines, paragraphs, environments, or
sections.

@table @kbd
@item @key{TAB}
@kindex @key{TAB}
@findex LaTeX-indent-line
@code{LaTeX-indent-line} will indent the current line.

@item @key{LFD}
@kindex @key{LFD}
@code{reindent-then-newline-and-indent} indents the current line, and
then inserts a new line (much like @key{RET}) and move the cursor to an
appropriate position by the left margin.

@item M-q
@kindex M-q
Alias for @kbd{C-c C-q C-p}

@item C-c C-q C-p
@kindex C-c C-q C-p
@findex LaTeX-format-paragraph
@code{LaTeX-format-paragraph} will reformat or `fill' the current
paragraph.

@item C-c C-q C-e
@kindex C-c C-q C-e
@findex LaTeX-format-environment
@code{LaTeX-format-environment} will reformat or `fill' the current
environment.  This may e.g. be the `document' environment, in which case
the entire document will be formatted.

@item C-c C-q C-s
@kindex C-c C-q C-s
@findex LaTeX-format-section
@code{LaTeX-format-section} will reformat or `fill' the current
logical sectional unit.

@item C-c C-q C-r
@kindex C-c C-q C-r
@findex LaTeX-format-region

them.

@deffn Command TeX-command-region
@kindex C-c C-r
(@kbd{C-c C-r})  Query the user for a command, and run it on the
``region file''.  Some commands (typically those invoking @TeX{} or
La@TeX{}) will write the current region into the region file, after
extracting the header and tailer from the master file.  The name of the
region file is controlled by the variable @code{TeX-region}.  The name of
the master file is controlled by the variable @code{TeX-master}.  The
header is all text up to the line matching the regular expression
@code{TeX-header-end}.  The trailer is all text from the line matching
the regular expression @code{TeX-trailer-start}.  The available commands

AUC @TeX{} will allow one process for each document, plus one process
for the region file to be active at the same time.  Thus, if you are
editing @var{n} different documents, you can have @var{n} plus one
processes running at the same time.  If the last process you started was
on the region, the commands described in @ref{Debugging} and
@ref{Control} will work on that process, otherwise they will work on the
process associated with the current document.

@defopt TeX-region
The name of the file for temporarily storing the text when formatting
the current region.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-header-end

is @samp{\begin@{document@}} in La@TeX{} mode and @samp{%**end of
header} in @TeX{} mode.@refill
@end defopt 

@defopt TeX-trailer-start
A regular expression matching the start of the trailer.  By default,
this is @samp{\end@{document@}} in La@TeX{} mode and @samp{\bye} in
@TeX{} mode.@refill
@end defopt

AUC @TeX{} will try to guess what command you want to invoke, but by
default it will assume that you want to run @TeX{} in @TeX{} mode and
La@TeX{} in La@TeX{} mode.  You can overwrite this by setting the
variable @code{TeX-command-default}.

@defopt TeX-command-default
The default command to run in this buffer.  Must be an entry in

If you want to overwrite the values of @code{TeX-header-end},
@code{TeX-trailer-start}, or @code{TeX-command-default}, you can do that
for all files by setting them in either @code{TeX-mode-hook},
@code{plain-TeX-mode-hook}, or @code{LaTeX-mode-hook}.  To overwrite
them for a single file, define them as file variables (@pxref{File

AUC @TeX{} will try to save any buffers related to the document, and
check if the document needs to be reformatted.  If the variable

each file.  By default AUC @TeX{} will check emacs buffers associated
with files in the current directory, in one of the
@code{TeX-macro-private} directories, and in the @code{TeX-macro-global}
directories.  You can change this by setting the variable
@code{TeX-check-path}.@refill

If you spread a document over many files (as you are likely to do if
there are multiple authors, or if you have not yet discovered the power
of the outline commands (@pxref{Outline})), that can be done by having a
``master'' file from where you include the various files with the @TeX{}
macro @samp{\input} or the La@TeX{} macro @samp{\include}.  These
files may also include other files themselves.  However, to format the
document you must run the commands on the top level file.@refill

When you for example ask AUC @TeX{} to run a command on the master file,
it has no way to know what the name of the master file is.  By default
it will assume that the current file is the master file.  If you insert
the following in your @file{.emacs} file AUC @TeX{} will use a more
advanced algorithm.

@lisp
(setq-default TeX-master nil) ; Query for master file.
@end lisp

If AUC @TeX{} finds the line indicating the end of the header in a
master file (@code{TeX-header-end}), it can figure out for itself that
this is a master file.  Otherwise, it will ask for the name of the
master file associated with the buffer.  To avoid asking you again, AUC
@TeX{} will automatically insert the name of the master file as a file
variable (@pxref{File Variables,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor}).  You can
also insert the file variable yourself, by putting the following text at
the end of your files.@refill
@findex TeX-header-end

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-master: "mymaster"
% End: 
@end example

You should always set this variable to the top level document.  If you
always use the same name for your top level documents, you can set
@code{TeX-master} in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq-default TeX-master "master") ; All master files called "master".
@end lisp

@defopt TeX-master
The master file associated with the current buffer.  If the file being
edited is actually included from another file, you can tell AUC @TeX{}
the name of the master file by setting this variable.  If there are
multiple levels of nesting, specify the top level file.@refill

If this variable is @code{nil}, AUC @TeX{} will query you for the
name.@refill

If the variable is @code{t}, AUC @TeX{} will assume the file is a master
file itself.@refill

If the variable is @code{shared}, AUC @TeX{} will query for the name,
but not change the file.@refill

It is suggested that you use the File Variables (@pxref{File
Variables,,,emacs,The Emacs Editor}) to set this variable permanently
for each file.@refill
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-one-master
Regular expression matching ordinary TeX files.

You should set this variable to match the name of all files, where
automatically adding a file variable with the name of the master file is
a good idea.  When AUC @TeX{} adds the name of the master file as a file
variable, it does not need to ask next time you edit the file.

If you dislike AUC @TeX{} automatically modifying your files, you can
set this variable to @samp{"<none>"}. By default, AUC @TeX{} will modify
any file with an extension of @samp{.tex}.@refill
@end defopt

AUC @TeX{} keeps track of macros, environments, labels, and style
files that are used in a given document.  For this to work with
multifile documents, AUC @TeX{} has to have a place to put the
information about the files in the document.  This is done by having an
@file{auto} subdirectory placed in the directory where your document is
located.  Each time you save a file, AUC @TeX{} will write information
about the file into the @file{auto} directory.  When you load a file,
AUC @TeX{} will then read the information in the @file{auto} directory
about the file you loaded, @emph{and the master file specified by
@code{TeX-master}}.  Since the master file (perhaps indirectly) includes
all other files in the document, AUC @TeX{} will get information from
all files in the document.  This means that you will get from each file 
e.g. completion for all labels defined anywhere in the document.

You must create the @file{auto} directory manually for this to work.  If
you don't do this, the other files in the document will not know
anything about each other, except for the name of the master file.

@chapter Automatic Parsing of @TeX{} files.
@cindex Parsing @TeX{}
@cindex Automatic Parsing
@cindex Tabs
@cindex Tabify
@cindex Untabify

AUC @TeX{} depends heavily on being able to extract information from the
buffers by parsing them.  Since parsing the buffer can be somewhat slow,
the parsing is initially disabled.  You are encouraged to enable them by
adding the following lines to your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-parse-self t) ; Enable parse on load.
(setq TeX-auto-save t) ; Enable parse on save.
@end lisp

The later command will make AUC @TeX{} store the parsed information in
an @file{auto} subdirectory in the directory each time the @TeX{} files
are stored, @pxref{Automatic Local}.  If AUC @TeX{} finds the pre-parsed
information when loading a file, it will not need to reparse the buffer.
The information in the @file{auto} directory is also useful for
multifile documents @pxref{Multifile}, since it allows each file to
access the parsed information from all the other files in the document.
This is done by first reading the information from the master file, and
then recursively the information from each file stored in the master
file.@refill

The variables can also be done on a per file basis, by changing the file
local variables.

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-parse-self: t
% TeX-auto-save: t
% End: 
@end example

Even when you have disabled the automatic parsing, you can force the
generation of style information by pressing @kbd{C-c C-n}.  This is
often the best choice, as you will be able to decide when it is
necessary to reparse the file.

@defopt TeX-parse-self
Parse file after loading it if no style hook is found for it.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-auto-save
Automatically save style information when saving the buffer.
@end defopt

@deffn Command TeX-normal-mode @var{arg}
@kindex C-c C-n
(@kbd{C-c C-n}) Remove all information about this buffer, and apply the
style hooks again.  Save buffer first including style information.  With
optional argument, also reload the style hooks.
@end deffn

When AUC TeX saves your buffer, it will by default convert all tabs in
your buffer into spaces.  To disable this behaviour, insert the
following in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-auto-untabify nil)
@end lisp

@defopt TeX-auto-untabify
Automatically remove all tabs from a file before saving it.
@end defopt

Instead of disabling the parsing entirely, you can also speed it
significantly up by limiting the information it will search for (and
store) when parsing the buffer.  You can do this by setting the default
values for the buffer local variables @code{TeX-auto-regexp-list} and
@code{TeX-auto-parse-length} in your @file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
;; Only parse \documentstyle information.
(setq-default TeX-auto-regexp-list 'LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list) 
;; The documentstyle command is usually near the beginning.
(setq-default TeX-auto-parse-length 2000)
@end lisp

This example will speed the parsing up significantly, but AUC @TeX{}
will not longer be able to provide completion for labels, macros,
environments, or bibitems specified in the document, nor will it know
what files belong to the document.

These variables can also be specified on a per file basis, by changing
the file local variables.

@example
% Local Variables: 
% TeX-auto-regexp-list: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
% TeX-auto-parse-length: 999999
% End: 
@end example

@defopt TeX-auto-regexp-list
List of regular expresions used for parsing the current file.
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-auto-parse-length
Maximal length of TeX file that will be parsed.
@end defopt

The pre-specified lists of regexps are defined below.  You can use these
before loading AUC @TeX{} by quoting them, as in the example above.

@defvr Constant TeX-auto-empty-regexp-list
Parse nothing
@end defvr

@defvr Constant LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list
Only parse documentstyle.
@end defvr

@defvr Constant LaTeX-auto-label-regexp-list

To write Japanese text with AUC @TeX{} you need to have versions of
@TeX{} and Emacs that support Japanese.  There exist at least two
variants of @TeX{} for Japanese text, and AUC @TeX{} can be used with
both, as well as with the two Japanese-aware Emacses, NEMACS and MULE.

To use the Japanese TeX variants, simply enter @code{japanese-tex-mode},
@code{japanese-latex-mode}, or @code{japanese-slitex-mode}, and
everything should work.  If not, send mail to Shinji Kobayashi
(@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}, who kindly donated the code for
supporting Japanese in AUC @TeX{}.  None of the primary AUC @TeX{}
maintainers understand Japanese, so they can not help you.

Since AUC @TeX{} is so highly customizable, it makes sense that it is able
to customize itself.  The automatic customization consists of scanning
@TeX{} files and extracting symbols, environments, and things like that.

The automatic customization is done on three different levels.  The
global level is the level shared by all users at your site, and consists
of scanning the standard @TeX{} style files, and any extra styles added
locally for all users on the site.  The private level deals with those
style files you have written for your own use, and use in different
documents.  You may have a @file{~/lib/TeX/} directory where you store
useful style files for your own use.  The local level is for a specific
directory, and deals with writing customization for the files for your
normal @TeX{} documents.

If you compare with the environment variable @code{TEXINPUTS}, the
global level corresponds to the directories built into @TeX{}.  The
private level corresponds to the directories you add yourself, except for
@file{.}, which is the local level.

* Automatic Private::           Automatic Customization for a User
* Automatic Local::             Automatic Customization for a Directory
@end menu

By default AUC @TeX{} will search for customization files in all the
global, private, and local style directories, but you can also set the
path directly.  This is useful if you for example want to add another
person's style hooks to your path.  Please note that all matching files
found in @code{TeX-style-path} are loaded, and all hooks defined in the
files will be executed.

@defopt TeX-style-path

Each must end with a slash.

By default, when AUC @TeX{} searches a directory for files, it will
recursively search through subdirectories. 

@defopt TeX-file-recurse
If not nil, search @TeX{} directories recursively.
@end defopt

By default, AUC @TeX{} will ignore files name @file{.}, @file{..},
@file{SCCS}, @file{RCS}, and @file{CVS}.

@defopt TeX-ignore-file 
Regular expression matching file names to ignore.

These files or directories will not be considered when searching for

Assuming that the automatic customization at the global level was done
when AUC @TeX{} was installed, your choice is now.  Will you use it?
If you use it, you will benefit by having access to all the symbols and
environments available for completion purposes.  The drawback is slower
load time when you edit a new file and perhaps too many confusing
symbols when you try to do a completion.

AUC @TeX{} can update the style information about a file each time you
save it, and it will do this if the directory @code{TeX-auto-local}
exist. @code{TeX-auto-local} is by default set to @samp{"auto/"}, so
simply creating an @file{auto} directory will enable automatic saving of
style information. 

The advantage of doing this is that macros, labels, etc. defined in any
file in a multifile document will be known in all the files in the
document.  The disadvantage is that saving will be slower.  To disable,
set @code{TeX-auto-local} to nil.

@end lisp

This file specifies that the largest kind of section in a LaTeX document
using the book document style is chapter.  The interesting thing to
notice is that the style file defines an (anonymous) function, and adds it
to the list of loaded style hooks by calling @code{TeX-add-style-hook}.

The first time the user indirectly tries to access some style specific
information, such as the largest sectioning command available, the style
hooks for all files directly or indirectly read by the current document
is executed.  The actual files will only be evaluated once, but the
hooks will be called for each buffer using the style file.

@cindex Defining macros in style hooks

The most common thing to define in a style hook is new symbols (@TeX{}
macros).  Most likely along with a description of the arguments to the
function, since the symbol itself can be defined automatically.

Here are a few examples from @file{latex.el}.

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
     (TeX-add-symbols
     '("arabic" TeX-arg-counter)
     '("label" TeX-arg-define-label)
     '("ref" TeX-arg-label)
     '("newcommand" TeX-arg-define-macro [ "Number of arguments" ] t)
     '("newtheorem" TeX-arg-define-environment
       [ TeX-arg-environment "Numbered like" ]
       t [ TeX-arg-counter "Within counter" ])))))
@end lisp

@defun TeX-add-symbols @var{symbol} @dots{}
Add each @var{symbol} to the list of known symbols.
@end defun

Each argument to @code{TeX-add-symbols} is a list describing one symbol.
The head of the list is the name if the symbol, the remaining elements
describe each argument.

If there are no additional elements, the symbol will be inserted with
point inside braces.  Otherwise, each argument of this function should
match an argument of the @TeX{} macro.  What is done depends on the argument
type.

If a macro is defined multiple times, AUC @TeX{} will chose the one with
the longest definition (i.e. the one with the most arguments).

Thus, to overwrite
@example
        '("tref" 1) ; one argument
@end example
you can specify 
@example
        '("tref" TeX-arg-label ignore) ; two arguments
@end example

@code{ignore} is a function that does not do anything, so when you
insert a @samp{tref} you will be prompted for a label and no more.

@table @code
@item string
Use the string as a prompt to prompt for the argument.

@item number
Insert that many braces, leave point inside the first.

@item nil
Insert empty braces.

@item t
Insert empty braces, leave point between the braces.

@item other symbols
Call the symbol as a function.  You can define your
own hook, or use one of the predefined argument hooks.

@item list
If the car is a string, insert it as a prompt and the next
element as initial input.  Otherwise, call the car of the list with
the remaining elements as arguments. 

@item vector
Optional argument.  If it has more than one element, parse it
as a list, otherwise parse the only element as above.  Use square
brackets instead of curly braces, and is not inserted on empty user
input.
@end table

A lot of argument hooks have already been defined.  The first argument to
all hooks is a flag indicating if it is an optional argument.  It is up
to the hook to determine what to do with the remaining arguments, if
any.  Typically the next argument is used to overwrite the default
prompt. 

@ftable @code
@item TeX-arg-conditional
Implements if EXPR THEN ELSE.  If EXPR evaluates to true, parse THEN as an
argument list, else parse ELSE as an argument list.

@item TeX-arg-literal
Insert its arguments into the buffer.  Used for specifying extra syntax
for a macro.

@item TeX-arg-free
Parse its arguments but use no braces when they are inserted.

@item TeX-arg-eval
Evaluate arguments and insert the result in the buffer.

@item TeX-arg-file
Prompt for a tex or sty filename, and use it without the extension. Run
the file hooks defined for it.

@item TeX-arg-label
Prompt for a label completing with known labels.

@item TeX-arg-macro
Prompt for a @TeX{} macro with completion.

@item TeX-arg-environment
Prompt for a La@TeX{} environment with completion.

@item TeX-arg-cite
Prompt for a Bib@TeX{} citation.

@item TeX-arg-counter
Prompt for a La@TeX{} counter.

@item TeX-arg-savebox
Prompt for a La@TeX{} savebox.

@item TeX-arg-file
Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without the
extension.

@item TeX-arg-input-file
Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without the
extension.  Run the style hooks for the file.

@item TeX-arg-define-label
Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  Add label to list of
defined labels.

@item TeX-arg-define-macro
Prompt for a @TeX{} macro with completion.  Add macro to list of defined
macros.

@item TeX-arg-define-environment
Prompt for a La@TeX{} environment with completion.  Add environment to
list of defined environments.

@item TeX-arg-define-cite
Prompt for a Bib@TeX{} citation.

@item TeX-arg-define-counter
Prompt for a La@TeX{} counter.

@item TeX-arg-define-savebox
Prompt for a La@TeX{} savebox.

@item TeX-arg-corner
Prompt for a La@TeX{} side or corner position with completion.

@item TeX-arg-lr
Prompt for a La@TeX{} side with completion.

@item TeX-arg-tb
Prompt for a La@TeX{} side with completion.

@item TeX-arg-pagestyle
Prompt for a La@TeX{} pagestyle with completion.

@item TeX-arg-verb
Prompt for delimiter and text.

@item TeX-arg-pair
Insert a pair of numbers, use arguments for prompt. The numbers are
surrounded by parentheses and separated with a comma.

@item TeX-arg-size
Insert width and height as a pair.  No arguments.

@item TeX-arg-coordinate
Insert x and y coordinates as a pair.  No arguments.
@end ftable

If you add new hooks, you can assume that point is placed directly after
the previous argument, or after the macro name if this is the first
argument.  Please leave point located after the argument you are
inserting.  If you want point to be located somewhere else after all
hooks have been processed, set the value of @code{exit-mark}.  It will
point nowhere, until the argument hook sets it.@refill

@node Adding Environments, Adding Other, Adding Macros, Style Files
@section Adding Support for Environments
@cindex Adding environments
@cindex Environments, adding
@cindex Defining environments in style hooks

Adding support for environments is very much like adding support for
@TeX{} macros, except that each environment normally only takes one
argument, an environment hook.  The example is again a short version of
@file{latex.el}.

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("document" LaTeX-env-document)
     '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-item)
     '("itemize" LaTeX-env-item)
     '("list" LaTeX-env-list)))))
@end lisp 

@findex LaTeX-env-item
The only hook that is general useful is @code{LaTeX-env-item}, which is
used for environments that contain items.  It is completely up to the
environment hook to insert the environment, but the function
@code{LaTeX-insert-environment} may be to some help.  The hook will be
called with the name of the environment as its first argument, and extra
arguments can be provided by adding them to a list after the hook.

For simple environments with arguments, for example defined with
@samp{\newenvironment}, you can make AUC @TeX{} prompt for the arguments
by giving the prompt strings in the call to
@code{LaTeX-add-environments}.  For example, if you have defined a
@code{loop} environment with the three arguments @var{from}, @var{to},
and @var{step}, you can add support for them in a style file.

@example
%% loop.sty

\newenvironment@{loop@}[3]@{...@}@{...@}
@end example

@lisp
;; loop.el

(TeX-add-style-hook "loop"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("loop" "From" "To" "Step")))))
@end lisp

If an environment is defined multiple times, AUC @TeX{} will chose the
one with the longest definition.  Thus, if you have an enumerate style
file, and want it to replace the standard La@TeX{} enumerate hook above,
you could define an @file{enumerate.el} file as follows, and place it in
the appropriate style directory. 

@lisp
(TeX-add-style-hook "latex"
 (function
  (lambda ()
    (LaTeX-add-environments
     '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-enumerate foo)))))

(defun LaTeX-env-enumerate (environment &optional ignore) ...)
@end lisp

The symbol @code{foo} will be passed to @code{LaTeX-env-enumerate} as
the second argument, but since we only added it to overwrite the
definition in @file{latex.el} it is just ignored.

@defun LaTeX-add-environments @var{env} @dots{}
Add each @var{env} to list of loaded environments.
@end defun

@defun LaTeX-insert-environment @var{env} [ @var{extra} ]

@section Automatic Extraction of New Things
@cindex Parsing new macros
@cindex @file{macro.tex}
@cindex @file{macro.el}
@cindex Changing the parser

The automatic @TeX{} information extractor works by searching for
regular expressions in the @TeX{} files, and storing the matched
information.  You can add support for new constructs to the parser,
something that is needed when you add new commands to define symbols.  

For example, in the file @file{macro.tex} I define the following macro.

@example
\newcommand@{\newmacro@}[5]@{%
\def#1@{#3\index@{#4@@#5~cite@{#4@}@}\nocite@{#4@}@}%
\def#2@{#5\index@{#4@@#5~cite@{#4@}@}\nocite@{#4@}@}%
@}
@end example

AUC @TeX{} will automatically figure out that @samp{newmacro} is a macro
that takes five arguments.  However, it is not smart enough to
automatically see that each time we use the macro, two new macros are
defined.  We can specify this information in a style hook file.

;;; macro.el ends here
@end lisp

When this file is first loaded, it adds a new entry to
@code{TeX-newmacro-regexp}, and defines a function to be called before
the parsing starts, and one to be called after the parsing is done.  It
also declares a variable to contain the data collected during parsing.
Finally, it adds a style hook which describes the @samp{newmacro} macro,
as we have seen it before.

So the general strategy is: Add new entry to @code{TeX-newmacro-regexp}.
Declare variable to contain intermediate data during parsing.  Add hook
to be called before and after parsing.  In this case, the hook before
parsing just initialize the variable, and the hook after parsing
collect the data from the variable, and add them to the list of symbols
found.  

@defvar TeX-auto-regexp-list
List of regular expressions matching @TeX{} macro definitions.

The list has the following format ((REGEXP MATCH TABLE) @dots{}), that
is, each entry is a list with three elements.

REGEXP.  Regular expression matching the macro we want to parse.

MATCH.  A number or list of numbers, each representing one
parenthesized subexpression matched by REGEXP.

TABLE.  The symbol table to store the data.  This can be a function, in
which case the function is called with the argument MATCH.  Use
@code{TeX-match-buffer} to get match data.  If it is not a function, it
is presumed to be the name of a variable containing a list of match
data.  The matched data (a string if MATCH is a number, a list of
strings if MATCH is a list of numbers) is put in front of the table.
@end defvar

@defvar TeX-auto-prepare-hook nil
List of functions to be called before parsing a @TeX{} file.
@end defvar

@defvar TeX-auto-cleanup-hook nil
List of functions to be called after parsing a @TeX{} file.

Before you do anything else, make sure that you have the latest version
of @TeX{}info installed.  It is available by ftp from
@samp{prep.ai.mit.edu}.  You need at least version 2.16.

First, you should consult the file @file{tex-site.el} and edit it to fit
your local site.  Be sure to get the following two variables right, or
you will not be able to complete the installation procedure:

@defopt TeX-lisp-directory
The directory where you want to install the AUC @TeX{} lisp files. 
@end defopt

@defopt TeX-macro-global
Directories containing the site's @TeX{} style files.
@end defopt

You probably also need to change @code{TeX-command-list} to make sure
that the commands used for starting @TeX{}, printing, etc. work on your
system. 
@vindex TeX-command-list

Finally, edit @code{TeX-printer-list} to contain the printers available
at your site.
@vindex TeX-printer-list

Next, edit the file @file{Makefile} in the AUC @TeX{} directory to set up
paths for installation of the files.  Be sure that

@table @code
@item bindir
Is set to the directory where you want the LaCheck binary to be
installed.

@item infodir
Is set to the directory where you want the AUC @TeX{} ``info''
documentation to be installed.  

@item aucdir
Is set to the directory where you want the lisp files for AUC @TeX{} to
be installed.  This @strong{must} be the same directory as you specified
for @code{TeX-lisp-directory} in @file{tex-site.el}.  If you unpacked
AUC @TeX{} in that directory (@code{TeX-lisp-directory}), you should set
@code{aucdir} to @samp{.} in order to avoid copying the byte compiled
lisp files.

If you already have an old version of AUC @TeX{} in that directory, you
must delete it before installing the new version.  Otherwise the wrong
version of the files may be loaded during the byte compilation.

@item mandir
Is set to the directory where you want to install the (unformatted) man
page for LaCheck.

@item elispdir
Is set to the directory where the lisp files from the standard Emacs
distribution are found.  

@item CC
Is the compiler you want to use for compiling the LaCheck program. Is
set to `gcc' by default. Change this is `cc' or whatever your system
compiler is called if you do not have GCC installed.

@end table

Then type @kbd{make all}, and the whole thing will be `made'.  If this
succeeds, type @kbd{make install}, and it will be installed.

To extract information from your site's @TeX{} macros, type @kbd{make
install-auto}. This will only work if you have set
@code{TeX-macro-global} correctly in @file{tex-site.el}.

Tell the users on your site to insert
@lisp 
        (load-file "/path/for/auctex/tex-site.elc")
@end lisp
in their @file{.emacs} file in order to use AUC @TeX{}.

Users who know the older keybindings from version 6.1 may also want to
insert 
@lisp
        (load "auc-tex")
@end lisp
in their @file{.emacs}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Now get keyboard accelerators on all menus rather than only AUC @TeX{}
menus, thanks to the @file{powerkey.el} file by Lars Lindberg
@samp{<lli@@sypro.cap.se>}.

@item
Added @code{TeX-electric-macro} for faster completion of @TeX{} macros.
@xref{Completion}.

@item
Comparing printer names are now case incentive.  Thanks to Richard
Stanton @samp{<stanton@@haas.berkeley.edu>}.

@item
Default shell fixed for OS/2.  Thanks to Richard Stanton
@samp{<stanton@@haas.berkeley.edu>}.

@item
Added functions to hide (@code{LaTeX-hide-environment}) and show
(@code{LaTeX-show-environment}) the current environment.

@item
@kbd{C-u C-c C-e} will now modify the current environment instead of
inserting a new environment.  This is like the optional argument to the
font commands.

@item
Added nabla to LaTeX Math Mode.  Suggested by Bill Reynolds
@samp{<bill@@goshawk.lanl.gov>}. 

@item
Added commands for running @TeX{} and La@TeX{} interactively.  Thanks to
David Carlisle @samp{<carlisle@@computer-science.manchester.ac.uk>}.

@item
The external commands will now insert there output @emph{before} point
in the output buffers.  This allows you to follow the progress by
putting point at the end of the file.  Suggested by Jak Kirman
@samp{<jak@@cs.brown.edu>}.

@item
When invoking an external command from a menu, the document will be
automatically saved. 

@item
There are now a printer menu for emacs 19.

@item
Redesigned dependecy checking.  Now only checks dependencies for files
loaded in the current emacs session.  This is much faster, but will not
catch files that are edited outside this emacs session, or files edited
in killed buffers.  @strong{@code{TeX-check-path} must at least contain
@file{.} for saving to work}.  If you have set @samp{TeX-check-path}
in your @file{.emacs} file, remove it.  The default value is fast enough
now.

@item
New variable @code{TeX-save-query} control if AUC @TeX{} will query you
for each modified buffer when you save the document.  Set it to nil to
get rid of these questions.  Setting this variable also affect the
automatic saving of the document that happens each time you start an
external command.

@item
New command @code{TeX-save-document} will save all files in the current
document, i.e. the document associated with the current buffer.

@item 
Cleaned up all minor modes, also made them use @file{min-map.el} or
@file{min-mode.el} instead of @file{min-bind.el}.

@item
Removed information about minor modes from this document.

@item
Cleaned up release management.

@item
AUC TeX will not longer be confused when you rewrite a file under a new
name. 

@item
The choice of ispell dictionary is now done in the when loading the
style files, instead of when starting ispell.

@item
Lots of code cleanup, involving reformating the source and renaming all
@samp{-hook} variables and functions to conform with the Emacs 19
guidelines. 

@item 
Can now parse Japanese characters in labels and macros when you use
Japanese @TeX{}.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}.

@item 
Made it safe to quit when AUC @TeX{} asks for the name of the master
file.  It will simply assume the file itself is the master, and continue
without inserting any file local variables.

@item
Support for @code{epsf} and @code{psfig} style files.  Thanks to Marc
Gemis @samp{<makke@@wins.uia.ac.be>}.

@item
Support for La@TeX{}info.  Thanks to Marc Gemis
@samp{<makke@@wins.uia.ac.be>}.

@item
Only examine the first 10000 bytes to find out what @TeX{} mode to use.

@item 
Added @code{TeX-submit-bug-report} command to submit bug reports.  It
uses the @file{reporter.el} distributed with SuperCite, so it may not be
available in some Emacs 18 installations.

@item
Speeded up parsing significantly by using a simpler regexp.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-auto-untabify}.  Set it to nil to prevent
untabifying the buffer when it is saved.  Several people wanted this. 

@item
Changed defaults to @emph{not} do any automatic parsing, nor prompt for
a master file.  @xref{Parsing Files}, @ref{Multifile}, for information
about how ot correct this.  In short, insert the following in your
@file{.emacs} file.

@lisp
(setq TeX-auto-save t)
(setq TeX-parse-self t)
(setq-default TeX-master nil)
@end lisp

@item
Some grammatical fixes to the @file{PROBLEMS} file.  Thanks to Lawrence
R. Dodd @samp{<dodd@@roebling.poly.edu>}.

@item
No longer install a separate @code{outline-minor-mode} by default, as
the FSF Emacs 19.19 @code{outline-minor-mode} is adequate.  The included
file @file{outln-18.el} emulates the FSF Emacs 19.19 mode under Emacs 18.

The FSF Emacs 19.19 @code{outline-minor-mode} use the @kbd{C-c} prefix
instead of @kbd{C-c C-o} by default, and does not bind as many keys as
the @code{outline-minor-mode} distributed with earlier versions of AUC
@TeX{} did.  You can get the keybindings back together with other
goodies by inserting
@example
(require 'out-xtra)
@end example
in your @file{.emacs} file.  @file{out-xtra.el} will probably be
unbundled from AUC @TeX{} in the future.

@item
Some fixes to AmS-@TeX{} mode by Ulf Juergens
@samp{<ulf@@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de>}.

@item
Make @samp{plain-TeX-mode-menu} work in Lucid Emacs.  Thanks to Anthony
Rossini @samp{rossini@@hsph.harvard.edu} for reporting this.

@item
First cut on a @TeX{}info mode.

@item
More strict about parsing @samp{\bibitem}'s and Bib@TeX{} entries.

@item
Made it easier to write style files for environments that takes
arguments and documented it.  Suggested by Martin
Wunderli @samp{<wunderli@@inf.ethz.ch>}.

@item
Parse optional argument to @samp{\newenvironment}.  Suggested by Martin
Wunderli @samp{<wunderli@@inf.ethz.ch>}.

@item
Fixed @samp{parbox} macro.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>}.

@item
Made the parser work better in outline minor mode.  Thanks to Salvador
Pinto Abreu @samp{<spa@@khosta.fct.unl.pt>}.

@item
Also save style information with @code{TeX-normal-mode} when buffer not
modified.

@item
Use @code{$(MAKE)} instead of @samp{make} to invoke @code{make} from the
@file{Makefile}.  Thanks to John Interrante
@samp{<interran@@uluru.Stanford.EDU>}. 

@item
Make last value default for @code{TeX-insert-macro}.  Suggested by Matt
Fairtlough @samp{<M.Fairtlough@@dcs.sheffield.ac.uk>}.

@item
Renamed info file to @samp{auc-info} in order to fil DOS file limits.
Please remember to update your @file{dir} file to reflect this change.

@item
Delete auto file instead of saving an empty file.

@itemize @bullet
@item
More robust installation, especially for Lucid Emacs (I hope).  Many
people reported problems with this.

@item
Make `easymenu' work when byte-compiled.  Many people reported this
bug.

@item
Minimally updated the @file{README} file from version 6.0 (sigh).
Thanks to Boris Goldowsky @samp{<boris@@cs.rochester.edu>} for reporting
this.

@item
Added @samp{@@finalout} to manual.  Reported by Henrik Drabol
@samp{<hvd@@ens004.ens.min.dk>}.

@item
Fixed @kbd{M-q} to work after an @samp{\end@{@dots{}@}}.  It will not
work at the end of the buffer, but there are usually the local variables
so it should (hopefully) not matter.  Thanks to Shinji Kobayashi
@samp{<koba@@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>} again.

@item
New variables @code{TeX-open-quote} and @code{TeX-close-quote} determine
what is inserted by @code{TeX-insert-quote}.  The @file{german} style
file now use those variables instead of changing the keymap.

@item
Changes to the default settings in @file{tex-site.el}, in particular a
@samp{Queue} command is added to display the print queue.  Thanks to
John Interrante @samp{<interran@@uluru.Stanford.EDU>} for code, and
other members of the @samp{auc-tex@@iesd.auc.dk} mailing list for
ideas.

@item
Make sure all outline mode commands are bound in
@code{outline-minor-mode}. 

@item
Added autoload for @code{TeX-command}.  Thanks to Hanno Wirth
@samp{<wirth@@igd.fhg.de>} for reporting this.

@item
Added support for AmS@TeX{} and AmSLa@TeX{}.  Currently they are
identical to @TeX{} and La@TeX{} except for another default command. 

@item
Added Vor@TeX{} style matching of dollar sign.  The style is guaranteed
to be Vor@TeX{}, since I lifted the code directly from Vor@TeX{}.
Thanks to Pehong Chen @samp{<phc@@renoir.berkeley.edu>} for writing the
Vor@TeX{} code.  Thanks to Jak Kirman @samp{<jak@@cs.brown.edu>} for
pointing out this nice Vor@TeX{} feature.

@item
Added information about AUC @TeX{} mail addresses to the manual.  Thanks
to Dave Smith @samp{<maa507@@computing.lancaster.ac.uk>}.

@item
Added menu to for plain @TeX{}.  Suggested by Tim Carlson
@samp{<imsgtcar@@math.montana.edu>}. 

@item
Made the menus depend on @code{TeX-command-list}.

@item
Made it possible to specify @code{TeX-auto-regexp-list} in the local
variable section of each file.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-auto-parse-length} to specify maximal length of
text that will be parsed.

@item
Added automatic parsing of Bib@TeX{} files and @samp{bibitem} entries in
order to get completion in @samp{cite}.  This was inspired by an add on
made by Sridhar Anandakrishnan @samp{<sak@@essc.psu.edu>}.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-byte-compile} to disable automatic byte
compilation of style files when loaded.  This is needed when using
different Emacs versions.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-translate-location-hook} to translate file and
line information before showing an error, as requested by Thorbjoern
Ravn Andersen @samp{<ravn@@imada.ou.dk>}.

@item
Added variable @code{TeX-auto-save} to allow disabling the automatic
saving of style information, either per file in the file local
variables, or globally by using @code{setq-default}.  Use
@code{TeX-normal-mode} to force style information to be saved.

@item
Try to create @file{auto} directory if it does not exists.

@item
Added chapter describing how to tune the @TeX{} parsing.

@item
Allow (but do not encourage) a string value for
@code{LaTeX-default-options}. 

@item
Give @samp{"} word syntax when german.sty is loaded.  Suggested by Tim

@kbd{C-c C-f C-d} now deletes the current font.  The current font is
defined to be the innermost @TeX{} group starting with a @TeX{} macro
that is terminated by a space.

@item
Giving @kbd{C-c C-f} a prefix argument will replace the current font,
i.e. @kbd{C-u C-c C-f C-b} will change the current font to bold. 

The old functionality (putting the font around the region) has been

New keymap. 

The keymap has been changed in order to make it more intuitive to new
users, and because the old bindings did not work well with the new
buffer manipulation commands in tex-buf.el.  To use the new bindings,
load @file{tex-init.el} instead of @file{auc-tex.el}.

The file @file{auc-tex.el} is still available and implements the old
keybinding on top of the new code.

Print out the reference card (@file{doc/ref-card.tex}) to see the new
bindings.  

@item
Completely redesigned the buffer handling. 

No part of the interface or the customization variables remain the same,
unless you use the compatibility functions in @file{auc-tex.el}.  In
that case the interactive commands remain similar in spirit, but the
customization interface is still changed. 

The file @file{tex-buf.el} has been completely rewritten, and there are
major cleanup in @file{tex-dbg.el}, however the basic functionality
remains the same in this file.  The code for both @file{tex-buf.el} and
@file{tex-dbg.el} should be much simpler now and easier to extent.

@file{auc-tex.el} and @file{tex-site.el} was updated to support the new
interface.  I actually believe the moral equivalent to @code{TeX-region}
to work now @samp{:-)}, at least I understand the code now.

The two major functions are now @code{TeX-command-master} and
@code{TeX-command-region}.  Each function will prompt you for the
command to execute.  AUC @TeX{} will make an educated guess on what
command you want to run, and make that the default.  The available
commands are defined in the variable @code{TeX-command-list}.

@code{TeX-command-master} will run the specified command on the buffers
master file.  You can have one command running for each master file.
@code{TeX-command-region} will run the specified command on the current
region, getting the header on trailer from the master file.  

You can have exactly one region command running, independent on how many
master file commands that are running.  Commands that operate on the
active process (like @code{TeX-next-error}) will chose the process
associated with buffers master file, unless the last region process is
more recent than all master file processes.

AUC @TeX{} now insist on knowing the master file for a buffer.  If you
do not specify it in the file variable section, and it is not obviously
a master file itself, it will ask you.  It will also add the master file
name to the file variables, unless you disable this feature by setting
@code{TeX-add-local} to nil.  Furthermore, it will convert @samp{%%
Master:} lines to file variables, unless you disable it by setting
@code{TeX-convert-master} to nil.
@vindex TeX-convert-master

Functionality removed (for now, it might appear again latter) include
all other functions to start a command (e.g. @code{LaTeX-BibTeX}), and
alternative ways to specify headers and trailers.  The only place to get
the header and trailer is from the master file (I can easily change
that, if anyone have such needs).

@item
Style specific code isolated.

You can now add style specific information to AUC TeX by writing a
style file somewhere in TeX-style-path.

The main code is now organized around this principle.

@item
Automatically generate style files.

AUC @TeX{} can now automatically extract information from a @TeX{} file,
and will do this when you save a buffer.

@item
Sli@TeX{} mode.

Just like La@TeX{} mode, except that the default command to format run
on the buffer is @samp{slitex}.

@item
@code{LaTeX-section} completely general.

Rewrote @file{ltx-sec.el}.

@itemize @minus
@item
Sectioning level, toc, and title queries can be individually turned off.
@item
Label query can be turned on or off for selected sectioning levels.
@item
Label prefix can be different for different sectioning levels.
@item 
If the title (or toc) is empty, point will be positioned there.
@item
Users can add new hooks
@end itemize

@item
@code{TeX-insert-macro} much smarter.

It will now prompt for the symbol with completions, and for many symbols
it will also prompt for each argument.  There are also completion on
some of the arguments.

@item
Fixed center in figure environment. 

Thanks to Thomas Koenig @samp{<ig25@@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>}.

@item
Changed @code{\M-} to @code{\e} in all keybindings in order to better
support 8-bit input on some GNU Emacs. Thanks to Peter Dalgaard
@samp{<pd@@kubism.ku.dk>}.

Please, implementors of 8-bit input extensions to GNU Emacs.
@code{\M-x} does @emph{not} means @dfn{@kbd{x} with the 8-bit set}.  It
means @dfn{pressing @kbd{x} while holding down the @key{META} key}.
Some systems (such as X11) are able to tell the different.  Thus, even
if you implement 256 byte keymaps, @code{\M-x} should still expand
@code{meta-prefix-char} followed by an @kbd{x} in the keymap.  This
allows you to distinguish pressing @kbd{x} while holding down the
@key{META} key from entering a literal 8-bit character.

@item
Made the outline commands aware of the document style.

That is, if the document style is @samp{article}, @samp{\section} will
be one level below the @samp{\documentstyle}, while if the style is
@samp{book}, @samp{\section} will be three levels below
@samp{\documentstyle}.  This will make @code{show-children} work better
at the top level.

@item
The makefiles are closer to GNU coding standard.

They now understand `prefix' and some other macros.

@item
Added hooks to be run after list of environments or list of completion
names are updated, and also added a hook to be called after each file
has been loaded. Thanks to Piet van Oostrum @samp{<piet@@cs.ruu.nl>}.

@item
Added @samp{*} to lot of @code{(interactive)} declarations.

@item
The outline commands are now always accessible from La@TeX{} mode.

@item
Generalized the keyboard remapping and double modes.

These are found in the file @file{min-key.el}. 

@item
Smart Comments.

Not really, but there are now two comment functions which use their
arguments to determine what to do, instead of four functions ignoring
their arguments.

@item
Add outline headers.

It is now possible to add extra outline headers, by setting the variable
@code{TeX-outline-extra}. 

@item 
Smart quotes even smarter.

If you press @kbd{"} twice, it will insert an real double quote instead
of two (or four) single quotes.  This is consistent with how remapping
in @file{min-key.el} is done.

@item
Automatically untabify buffer when you save it.

Hands up, everyone who have produced a `last revision' paper containing
an unreadable list of data in the back, because @TeX{} does not
understands tabs.

@item
Call show-all when you change major mode.

Thanks to Inge Frick's @samp{<inge@@nada.kth.se>} @file{kill-fix.el}
enhancement, outline minor mode can now guarantee that all text is shown
when you leave the minor mode, even if you leave the minor mode by
changing the major mode.

@item
Updated documentation for 7.0.

Also added key, variable, function, and concept indexes, as well as this
history section and a new chapter on multifile documents
(@pxref{Multifile}).@refill

Preliminary documentation is available in the directory @file{doc}.  It
isn't very well written, but I believe it covers most interesting points.
Comments, suggestions, or even rewrites of sections are VERY
WELCOME@dots{}

LaCheck has been incorporated in the package.  The source code for it is
available in the directory @file{lacheck} along with the documentation
for it.  Lacheck may also be used from the command line.  It is bound to
@kbd{C-c $}.

Some minor changes in:

@table @code
@item TeX-region
Should work better with @samp{Master:} option.

@item LaTeX-environment
Numerous new hooks added by Masayuki Kuwada.

@item TeX-command-on-region
Removed. @kbd{C-c C-o} used for @code{outline-minor-mode} instead.

And some additional minor fixes...

@node Ancient History,  , Version 6.0, History
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Ancient History

The origin of AUC @TeX{} is @file{tex-mode.el} from Emacs 16.  Lars
Peter Fischer @samp{<fischer@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the first functions to
insert font macros and Danish characters back in 1986.  Per Abrahamsen
@samp{<abraham@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the functions to insert environments
and sections, to indent the text, and the outline minor mode in 1987.
Kresten Krab Thorup @samp{<krab@@iesd.auc.dk>} wrote the buffer handling
and debugging functions, the macro completion, and much more, including
much improved indentation and text formatting functions.  He also made
the first public release in 1991, and was the main author and
coordinator of every release up to and including 6.0.

Thanks should also go to all the people who have been a great help
developing the AUC @TeX{} system.  Especially all the people on the
@samp{auc-tex} mailing list, who have been very helpful commenting and
pointing out weak points and errors.

This is a list of projects for AUC @TeX{}.  Bug reports and requests we
can not fix or honor right away will be added to this list.  If you have
some time for emacs lisp hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a
solution to one of the following problems.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Fix bug with @code{TeX-show-environment} from hidden document
environment.

@item
Explain how to get Bib@TeX{} completion for @samp{\cite} somewhere.

@item
Function to check if you are in math mode (between two dollar signs).
Suggested by Jan Erik Odegard @samp{<odegard@@dsp.rice.edu>}

@item
Allow @code{TeX-auto-private} and @code{TeX-style-private} to be lists
to mimic @code{TeX-macro-private}.

@item
Try to initialize @code{TeX-macro-private} from @code{BIBPATH} and
@code{TEXPATH}. 

@item
Allow whitespace more places during parsing, e.g. between macro and the
first argument, or between individual style options in
@samp{\documentstyle}. 

@item
The @samp{Spell} command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since last
spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla @samp{<rbhumbla@@ucsd.edu>}. 

@item
Add completion of macro arguments to @code{TeX-complete-symbol}.

@item
Make @key{.} check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
letters.  Make @key{,} and @key{.} remove italic correction.  

@item
Use Emacs 19 minubuffer history to choose between previewers, and other
stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
@samp{<interran@@uluru.Stanford.EDU>}. 

@item
Control @TeX{} compilation window.

It is not good that half of the screen is wasted for the log when @TeX{}
is processing a file. It is possible to make the log screen smaller, but
the best solution would be to have a user configurable window layout
that could be defined by some variables as for VM or GNUS. Or a log
screen that opens only in case of an error. --- Tim Geisler
@samp{<tmgeisle@@immd8.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>}

@item 
Make features.

A new command @code{TeX-update} (@kbd{C-c C-u}) could be used to create
an up to date dvi file by repeatedly running Bib@TeX{}, MakeIndex and
(La)@TeX{}, until an error occur or we are done.

An alternative is to have an @samp{Update} command that ensures the
@samp{dvi} file is up to date.  This could be called before printing and
previewing.

@item
Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style hook.
You can not set a variable that AUC TeX depends on, unless AUC TeX knows
that it has to run the style hooks first.

Here is the start of such a list.
@table @code

@item LaTeX-add-environments

@item TeX-add-symbols

@item LaTeX-add-labels

@item LaTeX-add-bibliographies

@item LaTeX-largest-level

@end table

The rules for what can be done in a format package hook are different. 

@item 
Correct indentation for table, math, and array environments.

@item
Customizable indentation for verbatim-like user defined environments.

@item 
Optional special indentation after an @samp{\item}.

@example
\begin@{itemize@}
\item blabalaskdfjlas lajf adf
      lkfjl  af jasl lkf jlsdf jlf 
\item f lk jldjf lajflkas flf af
\end@{itemize@}
@end example 

@item
Completion for counters and sboxes.

@item
Outline should be (better) supported in @TeX{} mode.

At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra. 

@item
@code{TeX-header-start} and @code{TeX-trailer-end}.

We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

@item
Plain @TeX{} and La@TeX{} specific header and trailer expressions.

We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the header
and trailer regexps. 

@item
Add support for original @code{TeX-mode} keybindings.

A third initialization file (@file{tex-mode.el}) containing an emulator
of the standard @code{TeX-mode} would help convince some people to
change to AUC @TeX{}.@refill

@item
Make @code{TeX-next-error} parse ahead and store the results in a list,
using markers to remember buffer positions in order to be more robust
with regard to line numbers and changed files.  This is what
@code{next-error} does. (Or did, until Emacs 19).

@item
When @code{LaTeX-environment} is given an argument, change the current
environment.  Be smart about @samp{\item[]} versus @samp{\item } and
labels like @samp{fig:} versus @samp{tab:}.

@item
Check out if lightening completion from Ultra @TeX{} is anything for us.

@item
Finish the TeXinfo mode.

@item
BibTeX mode.

@item
Support for AMSLaTeX style files.

@item
Better LaTeX letter environment.

Make a database system for addresses in the letter environment
Make the letter environment hook produce `documentstyle' too.
