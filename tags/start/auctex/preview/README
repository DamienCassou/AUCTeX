I do not know where to start.  This is the preview-latex project at
Sourceforge, <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.
There is a mailing list for developers, the web page is
<URL:http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/preview-latex-devel>
Send a message with just the word `help' as subject or body to
    preview-latex-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net
for more information.

Thr project is just starting.  Current state of affairs:  get Emacs at
least version 21.0.105 (available for pretesting purposes from
<URL:ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/unreadable/pretest>), versions
before that have EPS rendering support that is defective.  The current
version of EPS support is just a hack and workaround with a side
effect of sluggish response time, feel free to help the Emacs
development crew in producing something better.  Even that version
will exhibit quite a few display engine quirks.  Report bugs you can
reproduce along with the files needed to reproduce them.

Here is what currently works: edit Makefile to match your docstrip.cfg
file.  Call make.  make preview.el accessible to Emacs.  Load it by
putting (require 'preview) into your .emacs.  Be sure to have AucTeX
up and working.  C-c C-c g <RET> should then give you a graphics
preview, if you have a statement like
\usepackage[graphics,floats,textmath,displaymath,delayed]{preview}
in your document preample.

For more info, read preview.dvi which gets generated by calling make.

I included a sample file circ.tex which you can use for testing around
a bit, and which serves as sort of a reference for initial bug
reports.

Help out!
