@item
AUC @TeX{} is now less likely to suggest running Bib@TeX{} when it is
not needed.

@item
Press @kbd{M-x LaTeX-209-to-2e @key{ret}} to make a stab at converting a
La@TeX{} 2.09 header to La@TeX{}2e.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-m input @key{ret}} should be faster now on second try.

@item
New variable @code{LaTeX-left-right-indent-level} controls the
indentation added by @samp{\left}.

@item
@samp{\begin}, @samp{\end}, @samp{\left}, and @samp{\right} no longer
need to be at the beginning of the line to take effect. 

@item
You can now delete and replace La@TeX{}2e style fonts.

@item
Moved external commands to new menu.

@item
@kbd{C-c C-m cite @key{ret}} will prompt for multiple keys.

Better handling of @samp{"} with @file{german.sty}.

@item
New variable @code{LaTeX-paragraph-commands} lists La@TeX{} commands
that shouldn't be formatted as part of a paragraph.

@item
Older news moved to @file{HISTORY}.  It is not @TeX{}info able, but you
can get a plaintext version with @samp{make HISTORY}.

@item
See the new @file{ChangeLog} file for a more detailed list of changes.
The history section will now only contain user level changes.  If you
send me a patch, please also provide a ChangeLog entry.
