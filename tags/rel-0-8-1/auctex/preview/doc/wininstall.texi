Installation of @previewlatex{} has been verified to work (in order of
increasing operating speed) with current @acronym{CVS} versions of
@w{GNU Emacs}, and with both Cygwin and native versions of XEmacs.
Since various fixes in the installation procedure have been
incorporated for Windows lately, you should install the current release
of @previewlatex{}.

Ok, here are the steps to perform:
@enumerate
@item
The installation of @previewlatex{} will require the MSYS tool set from
@uref{http://www.mingw.org}.  If you have the Cygwin tool set from
@uref{http://cygwin.com} installed, that should do just fine as well,
but it is quite larger and slower.  If you need to compile Emacs/XEmacs
from source, you'll also need compilers and stuff that are also
available for both of those tool sets.  Compiling Emacs is outside of
the scope of this manual: good luck.  @previewlatex{} itself does not
(yet) require a @w{C compiler} for installation.  Without either of
those tool sets, however, you would need to generate your various
@file{Makefile} copies from the respective @file{Makefile.in} files by
hand, and that would mean quite a lot of guesswork.  There is no sense
going into too much details here: the instructions would change severely
between versions, and the above tool sets are easy enough to acquire to
make manual configuration unnecessary.

@item
Install a current version of XEmacs (such as 21.4.10) from
@uref{http://www.xemacs.org} or try getting and compiling an
@acronym{CVS} version of GNU Emacs from
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=emacs}.

@item
You need a working @TeX{} installation.  One popular installation under
Windows is @uref{http://www.miktex.org,Mik@TeX{}}.  Another much more
extensive system is @uref{http://www.tug.org/texlive,@w{@TeX{} live}}
which is rather close to its Unix cousins.

@item
Install @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex,@AUCTeX{}} according to
its instructions.  It is recommended that you install at least 11.14.
At the current point of time this means that you should forego
installing @AUCTeX{} from the XEmacs package repository (version 1.35):
it is not up to date.  If you insist, there are patch instructions for
older versions of @AUCTeX{} in
@ifset rawfile
the @file{INSTALL} file.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@ref{Prerequisites}.
@end ifclear

@item
You need a copy of @uref{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost,GhostScript}.

@item
@uref{http://www.perl.org,Perl} is needed for building the
documentation.  When we release tarballs for @previewlatex{}, we also
pregenerate the documentation.  If you install the @samp{prebuilt-docs}
tarball over the normal source after configuration is complete, the
dependencies for the documentation will be satisfied without needing to
run Perl.  If you are building @previewlatex{} from @acronym{CVS},
however, you'll need Perl.

@item
Now the fun stuff starts.  Unpack the @previewlatex{} distribution into
some installation directory.  @strong{Do not} unpack it right into your
Emacs' own directories: the installation will copy the material that
needs to be placed there.  Keep the installation directory separate:
you can remove its contents after installation completes.  Since you
are reading this, you probably have already unpacked @previewlatex{},
but it should still be easy to move it elsewhere now.

@item
Ready for takeoff.  Start some shell (typically @file{bash}) capable of
running @file{configure}, change into the installation directory and
call @code{./configure} with appropriate options.

Typical options you'll want to specify will be
@table @code
@item --with-emacs
if you are installing Emacs.  You can use
@samp{--with-emacs=@var{/path/to/emacs}} to specify the name of the
installed Emacs executable, complete with its path if necessary (if
Emacs is not within a directory specified in your @var{PATH}
environment setting).

@item --with-xemacs
If you are using XEmacs, of course use @samp{--with-xemacs} in the same
manner.

@item --with-texmf-dir=@var{dir}
This will specify the directory where your @TeX{} installation sits.  If
your @TeX{} installation does not conform to the TDS (@TeX{} directory
standard), you may need to specify more options to get everything in
place.  See
@ifset rawfile
the `Configure' section in the @file{INSTALL} file
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@ref{Configure}
@end ifclear
for more information about the available options.

@item --with-lispdir=@var{/dir}
This may be needed for GNU Emacs installation, but hopefully
@file{configure} should figure this out by itself.  Don't use this for
XEmacs, rather use

@item --with-packagedir=@var{/dir}
which gives the location of the package directory for XEmacs where
stuff should be installed.  Again, hopefully this is not necessary to
specify.
@end table

Some executables might not be found in your path.  That is not a good
idea, but you can get around by specifying environment variables to
@file{configure}:
@example
GS="@var{/path/to/GhostScript}" ./configure @dots{}
@end example
should work for this purpose.

@item
If you need to use the prebuilt documentation (see above), now is the
time to unpack it over the rest of the installation directory.

@item
Run @code{make} in the installation directory (we have had one report
that Emacs did not manage to byte compile the Elisp files, and that had
to be done by hand.  No idea about what might have gone wrong there).
	
@item
Run @code{make install} in the installation directory.

@item
The above will leave you with a file @file{preview-latex.el} in the
installation directory.  Emacs must load this on startup.  It may be
that your version of Emacs already has a place where it keeps such
startup files.  If not, copy it into a place in your Emacs
@code{load-path}, then put

@example
(load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)
@end example

into your @file{.emacs} file or, if you have more than one user using
your system, into the global @file{default.el} file.

@item
Load @file{circ.tex} into Emacs or XEmacs and see if you can generate
previews.

If this barfs and tells you that image type @samp{png} is not
supported, try adding the line

@example
(setq preview-image-type 'pnm)
@end example

at the end of your installed version of @file{preview-latex.el}.  If
this helps, complain to wherever you got your Emacs: all current
Emacs/XEmacs versions capable of running @previewlatex{} by now can be
compiled to support @acronym{PNG} images.  Which is important, because
@acronym{PNM} files take away @strong{vast} amount of disk space, and
thus also of load/save time.
@end enumerate

Well, that about is all.  Have fun!
