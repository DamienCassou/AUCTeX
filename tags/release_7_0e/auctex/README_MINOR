** min-map.el:  Minor Keymaps 

For authors of minor modes, who need to rebind one or more keys while
in the minor mode.  You can do this by hiding the old binding in a
variable, and then restore the binding when you leave the mode.
Unfortunately, this will usually not work if more than one minor mode
try to rebind the key.  You can solve this problem, by using the
following functions to bind keys in minor modes.  See the
documentation string for the individual functions for details.

Put in (require 'min-map) in the start of the file containing your
minor mode. 

Use minor-set-key to set a key in the minor keymap for a given minor
mode.

Use minor-call-shadow to call the key binding shadowed by a given
minor mode.

Use unbind-minor-mode to remove all key definitions for a given minor
mode.

** min-out.el:  Outline Minor Mode

Allows you to use the outline-mode commands while in another major
mode.  This is already integrated in LaTeX-mode.  You toggle the mode
with M-x outline-minor-mode.  If you want to support other major
modes, let them change the outline-regexp and outline-level-function.
outline-regexp matches header lines (by default lines starting with
one or more *'s), and outline-level-function calculate the level of
the header (by default the length of the string matched by
outline-regexp).

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'outline-minor-mode "min-out" "Toggle outline minor mode." t)
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-prefix-char)
(setq-default outline-prefix-char "\C-c\C-o") ; Change to get a better prefix
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-regexp)
(setq-default outline-regexp "[*\^l]+")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-level-function)
(setq-default outline-level-function 'outline-level-default)

** min-key.el:  Mapping the keyboard layout

Allows you to specify a language specific keyboard mapping between
various encodings of an alphabet.  You toggle the mode with M-x
keyboard-mode, and select a different mapping with M-x
keyboard-query-mapping.  It also allows you to convert the text in the
buffer between the supported encodings.  You can get the original
binding by typing the remaped key twice. 

Currently only encodings of the Danish alphabet is supported, but you
can add other alphabets by setting the variable `language-encodings'. 

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'keyboard-mode "min-key" "Toggle keyboard-mode." t)
(autoload 'keyboard-query-mapping "min-key" "Query keyboard-mode." t)
(autoload 'convert-character-query "min-key" "Convert between encodings." t)

You most likely want to define a short-cut for often used mappings.
The following two functions redefine the keys on an international
keyboard to generate danish characters, either Latin 1 or as TeX
macroes.

(defun dansk-double-mode (arg)
  "DK Latin1 keys on international keyboard."
  (interactive "P")
  (require 'min-key)
  (if (or (and (null arg) keyboard-mode)
	  (<= (prefix-numeric-value arg) 0))
      (keyboard-mode -1)
    (keyboard-set-mapping "Danish" "Keyboard Layout" "ISO 8859 Latin 1" t)
    (keyboard-mode 1)))

(defun tex-dk-double-mode (arg)
  "DK TeX keys on international keyboard."
  (interactive "P")
  (require 'min-key)
  (if (or (and (null arg) keyboard-mode)
	  (<= (prefix-numeric-value arg) 0))
      (keyboard-mode -1)
    (keyboard-set-mapping "Danish" "Keyboard Layout" "TeX" t)
    (keyboard-mode 1)))

** min-ind.el:  Automatic indentation

Auto-indent mode works by invoking indent-relative for TAB, and using
indent-relative-maybe as the indent-line-function for auto-fill, and
NEWLINE. Enter and leave with M-x auto-indent-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'auto-indent-mode "min-ind" "Toggle auto-indent-mode." t)

** min-ispl.el: Automatic ispell of words

In auto-ispell-mode `space' or `return' automatically trigger
`ispell-word' on previously typed word.  M-TAB will make an ispell
completion. Enter and leave with M-x auto-ispell-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'auto-ispell-mode "min-ispl" "Toggle auto-ispell-mode." t)

** ltx-dead.el: Accent's in LaTeX

Get TeX accent on letters by typing accent key followed by letter.
Enter and leave with M-x LaTeX-dead-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(setq LaTeX-dead-keys '(?' ?` ?\" ?^ ?~)) ; Remove those you don't need
(autoload 'LaTeX-dead-mode "ltx-dead" "Toggle LaTeX-dead-mode." t)

** tex-math.el: Mathematical macros in TeX

Bind mathematical to backquote.  You enter mathematical macros with
` letter, e.g. ` a will insert \alpha in the buffer.

To use, add to your init file:

(setq LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix "`") ; Change if you like ` as is.
(autoload 'LaTeX-math-mode "tex-math" "Toggle math mode." t)

** For your init file.
