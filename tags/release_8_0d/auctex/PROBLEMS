* You are not using UNIX or can't figure out how to install.

0. Delete any old version you have.

1. Edit tex-site.el.  Read the comments in the file.

2. Add (load-file "<Path to AUC TeX>/tex-site.el") to your .emacs file.

3. Byte compile the files with "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile *.el".

4. Optionally do a `M-x TeX-auto-generate-global' to get macro completion.

* You get errors during byte compilation.

This is almost always because some old version of AUC TeX gets loaded
during the compilation.  Make sure to remove all old versions, and try
again.  The Emacs 19 byte-compiler will give warning about free
variables and unknown functions.  Ignore them.

* You are using NeXT Emacs.

NeXT Emacs is broken, a workaround is available by ftp:

host: ftp.emacs.auc.dk
file: /pack/ftp/pub/emacs-lisp/get-proc-env.el.z (gzip'ed)

* You are mixing Emacs 18, FSF Emacs 19, and Lucid Emacs 19.

Make sure to use the correct byte-compiled files for each version.
You may want to disable the automatic byte compilation by setting 

        (setq TeX-byte-compile nil)

in your .emacs file.

* None if this completion or multifile stuff works...

It must be enabled first, insert this in your emacs:

	(setq-default TeX-master nil)
	(setq TeX-parse-self t)
	(setq TeX-auto-save t)

Read also the chapters about parsing and multifile documents in the
manual.  

* When I save `foo.bib' AUC TeX forgets the information in `foo.tex'.

For various reasons, AUC TeX ignores the extension when it store
information about a file, so you should use unique base names for your
files.  E.g. rename `foo.bib' to `foob.bib'.
