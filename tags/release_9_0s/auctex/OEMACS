Here is a short description of how to make AUC TeX work for OEMACS:
(A similar method should work for DEMACS)

STEP 1. Install the files at your PC. You can obtain AUC TeX by
	anonymous ftp from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.tar.Z.

	Unpack the file, and transfer it to your PC preserving the
	directory structure. The files should
	be placed in a subdirectory called auctex under your site-lisp
	directory (or under another directory on your load-path).
	WARNING: When transferring the files, LF should be converted
	to CR/LF pairs. Most unix programs that can write MS-DOS
	diskettes have a "text mode" that does this. Some of them also
	add an End-Of-File marker (^Z) at the end of the files (just
	in case you are going to use it under MS-DOS ver. 1.X :-) ).
	This will prevent byte-compiling. You may have to delete the
	^Z characters manually.
	ANOTHER WARNING: The names of the info files are too long for a
	DOS computer. If you want to install the info files, you
	should rename "auc-info" to "auc", and "auc-info-[123]" to 
	"auc-[123]".
	

STEP 2.	Edit the file tex-site.el:
	Set the variable TeX-lisp-directory to the directory where you
	placed AUC TeX, and TeX-macro-global to where you keep your
	.sty files:

(defvar TeX-lisp-directory "c:/emacs-19.19/site-lisp/auctex/"
  "*The directory where the AUC TeX lisp files are located.
The directory name *must* end with a slash.")
(defvar TeX-macro-global
  '("c:/emtex/texinput/")
  "*Directories containing the sites TeX macro files and style files.
The directory names *must* end with a slash.")

	The list TeX-command-list should be updated. You will need to
	remove single quotes (') from the command arguments, since
	COMMAND.COM does not do that, and does not (mis-)interpret the
	argument. You will probably also need to update the View
	command. It is the dvi2tty line that you should change. (the
	variable windows-system is set to 'pc).
	You should also comment away the lines with (La)TeX Interactive,
	as these commands don't work under DOS anyway.

(defvar TeX-command-list
  ;; You may have to remove the single quotes around the command
  ;; arguments if you use DOS.
  (list (list "TeX" "tex \\nonstopmode\\input %t" 'TeX-run-TeX nil t)
;;	(list "TeX Interactive" "tex %t" 'TeX-run-interactive nil t)
	(list "LaTeX" "latex \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}" 'TeX-run-LaTeX nil t)
;;	(list "LaTeX Interactive" "latex %t" 'TeX-run-interactive nil t)
	(list "SliTeX" "slitex \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}"
	      'TeX-run-LaTeX nil t)  
	(if (or window-system (getenv "DISPLAY"))
	    (list "View" "dviscr @scr.cnf %s " 'TeX-run-command t nil)
	  (list "View" "dvi2tty -q -w 132 %s " 'TeX-run-command t nil))


STEP 3. [OPTIONAL, BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED]
	Byte-compile AUC TeX. Start Emacs from the auctex directory.
	Load the file lpath.el (Use M-x load-file). Byte-compile
	everything using the command 
	C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory RET RET
	Errors like "end of file while parsing top level" probably
	means that you have a ^Z character in the end of your file.
	Remove them and try again.
	The file dbg-jp.el cannot compile. If you don't write
	Japanese, you won't miss it.

STEP 4.	Add the following line to your _emacs file
        (load-library "auctex/tex-site")
	
	You should probably also add the lines
	(setq tex-default-mode 'latex-mode)
	(setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) 

STEP 5. [OPTIONAL]
	EITHER:
	Compile the LaCheck utility using your favourite C compiler.
	Look in the .../auctex/lacheck/makefile file to see what should be
	done. I have not tried this, but I cannot see any reasons why
	it should not work.
	OR:
	Ftp a copy of a DOS binary from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/TeX/LaTeX

STEP 6. [OPTIONAL]
	Print the manual (approx. 75 pages). The dvi file is in the
	doc directory. The manual is worth reading, AUC TeX can do
	things you wouldn't suspect you need :-)

STEP 7. [OPTIONAL]
	Install the info files (did yu rename them before copying them
	to your DOS computer?). Move them to your info directory, and 
	add the following line to the menu in the dir file:
* AUC TeX: (auc).	AUC TeX. Improved TeX/LaTeX mode.
	In the file auc, you should replace the string "auc-info" by
	"auc". The string appears 4 times among the first 10 lines.


The whole package will use 1.2 MB of your precious harddisk space ---
but it's worth it! You could of course compress / delete everything
except the .elc files (250 kB). I haven't tried this (yet), so I don't
know if it has disastrous side effects.

PROBLEMS: I have experienced the following problems:
1) If LaTeX, the dvi viewer etc. cannot find a file name, it will try
to read a name from the keyboard via stdin, and hang. C-break can
often save the day. My dvi viewer has no problems reading the keyboard
once it has started since it then uses direct keyboard reads.

2) When the dvi viewer terminates, it changes from graphics mode to 25
lines text mode. If Emacs was in 43 or 50 lines mode, the screen is
now in 25 lines mode, but Emacs believes there are 43 (50) lines!
This has been reported to Darryl Okahata (the OEMACS maintainer), and
may be fixed in future versions of OEMACS.
