@include macros.texi
@c -----------------------

@itemize @bullet

@item Factor out @AUCTeX{} specific code

and provide alternatives.  This could make @previewlatex{} work with
Emacs' default @TeX{}/@LaTeX{} modes which some people prefer.  Also one
might provide an abstraction layer that would make it possible to embed
@previewlatex{}'s core mechanisms into Emacs calc.

@item Support other formats than just @LaTeX{}

plain @TeX{} users and Con@TeX{}t users should not have to feel left
out.  While Con@TeX{}t is not supported yet by @AUCTeX{}, at least
supporting plain would help people, and be a start for Con@TeX{}t as
well.  There are plain-based formats like MusiX@TeX{} that could benefit
a lot from @previewlatex{}.  The main part of the difficulties here is
to adapt @file{preview.dtx} to produce stuff not requiring @LaTeX{}.

@item Web page work

Currently, @previewlatex{}'s web page is not structured at all.  Better
navigation would be desirable, as well as separate News and Errata eye
catchers.

@item Manual improvements

@itemize @minus
@item Pepper the manual with screen shots and graphics

This will be of interest for the @acronym{HTML} and @TeX{} renditions
of the texinfo manual.  Except for maybe autoconverted ASCII art
versions of the @acronym{XBM} icons, the info rendition will usually be
restricted to text descriptions, however.

@item Fix duplicates

Various stuff appears several times.

@item Implement rendering pipelines for Emacs

The current @file{gs.el} interface is fundamentally flawed, not only
because of a broken implementation.  A general batchable and
daemonizable rendering infrastructure that can work on all kinds of
preview images for embedding into buffers is warranted.  This is the
best option for integrating the current work on @code{dvipng} and should
also help with

@item Working via @acronym{PDF}
 
Going via latexpdf/gs and a single file might be faster than the current
latex/dvips/gs path and could come handy for previewing documents
intended for use with pdflatex.

@item Integrate into ref@TeX{}

When referencing to equations and the like, the preview-images of the
source rather than plain text should be displayed.  If the preview in
question covers labels, those should appear in the bubble help and/or a
context menu.  Apropos:

@item Implement context menus

Right mouse key currently just kills previews.  Offer more options than
that.

@item Implement @LaTeX{} error indicators

Previews on erroneous @LaTeX{} passages might gain a red border or similar.

@item Pop up relevant online documentation for frequent errors

A lot of errors are of the "badly configured" variety.  Perhaps the
relevant info pages should be delivered in addition to the error
message.

@item Store cursor locations for closed previews, restore them when
reopening them.

@item Implement a table editing mode where every table cell gets output
as a separate preview.  Alternatively, output the complete table
metrics in a way that lets people click on individual cells for editing
purposes.

@item Benchmark and kill Emacs inefficiencies

Both the @LaTeX{} run under Emacs control as well as actual image
insertion in Emacs appear awfully slow.  Why?

@item Make a sane gamma (non)correction image @acronym{API} for Emacs

It is currently impossible to make Emacs screen colors and generated
colors match exactly because of gamma correction issues.
