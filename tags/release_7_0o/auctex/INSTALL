Installation of AUC TeX
***********************

   Before you do anything else, make sure that you have the latest
version of TeXinfo installed.  It is available by ftp from
`prep.ai.mit.edu'.  You need at least version 2.16.

   First, you should consult the file `tex-site.el' and edit it to fit
your local site.  Be sure to get the following two variables right, or
you will not be able to complete the installation procedure:

 -- User Option: TeX-lisp-directory
     The directory where you want to install the AUC TeX lisp files.

 -- User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the sites TeX style files.

   You probably also need to change `TeX-command-list' to make sure
that the commands used for starting TeX, printing, etc. works on your
system.

   Finally, edit `TeX-printer-list' to contain the printers available
at your site.

   Next, edit the file `Makefile' in the AUC TeX directory to set up
paths for installation of the files.  Be sure that

`bindir'
     Is set to the directory where you want the LaCheck binary to be
     installed.

`infodir'
     Is set to the directory where you want the AUC TeX "info"
     documentation to be installed.

`aucdir'
     Is set to the directory where you want the lisp files for AUC TeX
     to be installed.  This *must* be the same directory as you
     specified for `TeX-lisp-directory' in `tex-site.el'.  If you
     unpacked AUC TeX in that directory (`TeX-lisp-directory'), you
     should set `aucdir' to `.' in order to avoid copying the byte
     compiled lisp files.

`mandir'
     Is set to the directory where you want to install the
     (unformatted) man page for LaCheck.

`elispdir'
     Is set to the directory where the lisp files from the standard
     Emacs distribution is found.

   Then type `make all', and the whole thing will be `made'.  If this
succeeds, type `make install', and it will be installed.

   To extract information from your sites TeX macros, type `make
install-auto'. This will only work if you have set `TeX-macro-global'
correctly in `tex-site.el'.

   Tell the users on your site to insert
             (load-file "/path/for/auctex/tex-site.elc")
   in their `.emacs' file in order to use AUC TeX.

   Users who prefer the old 6.1 keybings should also insert
	     (load "auc-tex")
