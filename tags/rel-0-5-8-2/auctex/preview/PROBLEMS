* GhostScript failures

Most of the problems encountered come from interaction with
GhostScript.  It is a good idea to have a fairly recent version of
GhostScript installed.  In particular, the device names have changed
over the time, so you should check that the devices demanded by the
customizable variable preview-image-creators fit your version of
GhostScript, at least the entry corresponding to the current value of
preview-image-type.  While not being best in file size and image
quality, setting preview-image-creators to `jpeg' should probably be
one of the best bets, since that device name has not changed in quite
some time.

When GhostScript fails, the necessary information and messages from
Ghostscript go somewhere.  If GhostScript fails before starting to
process images, you'll find the information at the end of the process
buffer you can see with C-c C-l.  If GhostScript fails while
processing a particular image, this image will be tagged with
middle-clickable buttons for the error description and for the
corresponding source file.

The default options configurable with
M-x customize-variable RET preview-gs-options

include the options "-dTextAlphaBits=4" "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=4".
These options have been reported to make GhostScript 5.50 fail, but
are reported to work under GhostScript 6.51 and later.  If you are
experiencing problems, it might help to customize them away.  Of
course, this also takes away the joy of antialiasing, so upgrading
GhostScript might not be the worst idea after all.

* Font problems with DviPS
Some fonts have been reported to produce wrong characters with
preview-LaTeX.  Preview-LaTeX calls dvips by default with the option
-Pwww in order to get scalable fonts for nice results.  If you are
using antialiasing, however, the results might be sufficiently nice
with bitmapped fonts, anyway.  You might try -Ppdf for another stab at
scalable fonts, or other printer definitions.  Use
M-x customize-variable RET preview-dvips-command RET
in order to customize this.

* GNU Emacs versions prior to 21.1

Don't use them.  20.x will not work, 21.0.x were prereleases, anyway.

* GNU Emacs under Windows operating systems

As of GNU Emacs 21.1, no image support is available in Emacs under
Windows.  Without images, preview-latex is useless.  If it is
important to you, support the Emacs developer crew with regard to
image support (PostScript image support is *not* necessary).  I do not
use Windows myself, but will accept patches necessary to make
preview-latex work under it.

* XEmacs

Does not work yet.  Volunteers welcome.  Quite a bit of the necessary
work has already been sorted out.

* AucTeX up to 10.0g

AucTeX versions up to and including 10.0g have a bug in the
calculation of the offsets for the start of a region.  This affects
C-c C-r commands where the start of the region does not lie on the
start of a line.  To correct this, apply the following patch.

Cut this out and pipe through the patch program in the appropriate
directory.  Under Emacs, you can do this by first doing M-x cd RET and
then entering the directory in which the file to patch resides, then
marking the region in this file containing the patch and doing M-|
patch RET.

* LaTeX

preview-latex requires to correlate error messages from TeX with the
input text.  The delivered example file circ.tex contains ISO-8859-1
input characters (also called Latin-1).  If your language environment
is not properly set up, or your TeX version is rather old, TeX will,
for example, display ü (German u-Umlaut) as ^^fc.  In that case the
correlation will fail, with the result that the preview images get
misplaced.  Personally, I have set the environment variable LANG to
the string 'en_US.ISO8859-1'.  Your system may have different ways of
achieving something similar.

* x-symbol

Current versions of x-symbol confuse the line parsing of
preview-LaTeX.  They also confuse that of Auc-TeX, but with less
glaring consequences.  A solution is being worked on, but this depends
on a few factors that will probably lead to some changed APIs in
AucTeX.

* flyspell.el

flyspell-mode has a bug afflicting preview-latex operation.  The
following patch will help:
