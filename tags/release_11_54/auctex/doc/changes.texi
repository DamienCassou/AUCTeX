@itemize @bullet
@item
The parser (used e.g. for @code{TeX-auto-generate-global}) was extended
to recognize keywords common in @LaTeX{} packages and classes, like
``\DeclareRobustCommand'' or ``\RequirePackage''.  Additionally a bug
was fixed which led to duplicate entries in @AUCTeX{} style files.

@item
Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new @code{TeX-fold-dwim}
command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key binding.
In course of these changes new key bindings for unfolding commands where
introduced.  The old bindings are still present but will be phased out
in future releases.

@item
Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

@item
There is an experimental toolbar support now.  It is not activated by
default.  If you want to use it, add
@lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
@end lisp
to your init file.

@item
The manual now contains a new chapter ``Quick Start''.  It explains the
main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a new user
to start using @AUCTeX{}.

@item
A new section ``Font Locking'' was added to the manual which explains
syntax highlighting in @AUCTeX{} and its customization.  Together with
the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part of
the new chapter ``Display''.

@item
Keywords for syntax highlighting of @LaTeX{} constructs to be typeset in
bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.  Besides the
built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by customizing the
variable @samp{font-latex-user-keyword-classes}.  The customization
options can be found in the customization group
@samp{font-latex-keywords}.

@item
Verbatim content is now displayed with the @samp{fixed-pitch} face. (GNU
Emacs only)

@item
Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
anymore. (GNU Emacs only)

@item
Verbatim commands like @samp{\verb|...|} will not be broken anymore
during filling.

@item
You can customize the completion for graphic files with 
@code{LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file}.

@item
Support for the @LaTeX{} packages @samp{url}, @samp{listings},
@samp{jurabib} and @samp{csquotes} was added with regard to command
completion and syntax highlighting.

@item
Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

@item
Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of existing
node names.

@item
Setting the variable @code{LaTeX-float} to @code{nil} now means that you
will not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.  You
can get the old behaviour of @code{nil} by setting the variable to
@code{""}, i.e. an empty string.  See also @ref{Floats}.

@item
The XEmacs-specific bug concerning @code{overlays-at} was fixed.

@item
Lots of bug fixes.

@item
The @LaTeX{} math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
built supports it.  See the variable @code{LaTeX-math-menu-unicode},
@ref{Mathematics}.

@item
Bug fixes for XEmacs.

@c The following items weren't present at release time of 11.53:
@item
Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

@item
@command{start} is used for the viewer for Mik@TeX{} and fp@TeX{}.

@item
The variable @code{TeX-fold-preserve-comments} can now be customized to
deactivate folding in comments.
@end itemize

@c Not present at release time of 11.52.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Installation and menus under XEmacs work again (maybe for the first
time).

@item
Fontification of subscripts and superscripts is now disabled when the
fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

@item
Bug fixes in the build process.

@heading News in 11.51
@c Not present at release time of 11.51.

@itemize @bullet
@item
PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt,
this has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

@item
Omega support has been added.

@item
Bug fixes in the build process.

@item
@code{TeX-fold} now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.50

@itemize @bullet
@item
The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document can
now be controlled with the new @code{TeX-source-specials} minor mode
which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key binding
@kbd{C-c C-t C-s}.  If you have customized the variable
@code{TeX-command-list}, you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by typing
@code{M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET}, selecting
``Erase Customization'' and do your customization again with the new
default.

@item
The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain @TeX{},
@LaTeX{}, @ConTeXt{} etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
@code{TeX-command-list} has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
and the customization will not work correctly.

@item
Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g. footnotes or
citations, and environments in a buffer was added, @ref{Folding}.

@item
You can now control if indentation is done upon typing @key{RET} by
customizing the variable @code{TeX-newline-function}, @ref{Indenting}.

@item
Limited support for @code{doc.sty} and @code{ltxdoc.cls} (@samp{dtx}
files) was added.  The new doc@TeX{} mode provides functionality for
editing documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while staying
in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note that the mode
is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting does not work yet
in XEmacs.)

@item
For macro completion in doc@TeX{} mode the @AUCTeX{} style files
@file{doc.el}, @file{ltxdoc.el} and @file{ltx-base.el} were included.
The latter provides general support for low-level @LaTeX{} macros and
may be used with @LaTeX{} class and style files as well.  It is
currently not loaded automatically for those files.

@item
Support for @ConTeXt{} with a separate @ConTeXt{} mode is now included.
Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and English.

@item
The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
available functionality and customization options are explained in the
manual.

@item
Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line previews.
@AUCTeX{} now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

@item
If @code{TeX-master} is set to @code{t}, @AUCTeX{} will now query for a
master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
alone.  The new function @code{TeX-master-file-ask} (bound to @kbd{C-c
_} is provided for adding the variable manually.

@item
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display devices
which support such fontification.  The variable
@code{font-latex-title-fontity} can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

@item
Support for @code{alphanum.sty}, @code{beamer.cls}, @code{booktabs.sty},
@code{captcont.sty}, @code{emp.sty}, @code{paralist.sty},
@code{subfigure.sty} and @code{units.sty}/@code{nicefrac.sty} was added.
Credits go to the authors mentioned in the respective @AUCTeX{} style
files.

@item
Inserting graphics with @kbd{C-c RET \includegraphics RET} was improved.
See the variable @code{LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist}.
@c FIXME: Document this in the main part of the manual

@item
If @code{LaTeX-default-position} is @code{nil}, don't prompt for
position arguments in Tabular-like environments, see @ref{Tabular-like}.

@item
Completion for available packages when using @kbd{C-c RET \usepackage
RET} was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

@item
The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for paragraphs
and regions respectively which do both.

@item
Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited by
either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the variable
@code{font-latex-quotes}.

@item
Certain @TeX{}/@LaTeX{} keywords for functions, references, variables
and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
keywords by customizing the variables
@code{font-latex-match-function-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-reference-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-variable-keywords} and
@code{font-latex-match-warning-keywords}.

@item
If you include the style files @file{german} or @file{ngerman} in a
document (directly or via the @samp{babel} package), you should now
customize @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote} and
@code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote} instead of @code{TeX-open-quote},
@code{TeX-close-quote} and @code{TeX-quote-after-quote} if you want to
influence the type of quote insertion.

@item
Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line options
for it are now determined automatically by looking at the extension of
the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style}.

@item
You can control whether @code{TeX-insert-macro} (@kbd{C-c RET}) ask for
all optional arguments by customizing the variable
@code{TeX-insert-macro-default-style}, @ref{Completion}.

@item
@code{TeX-run-discard} is now able to completely detach a process that
it started.

@item
The build process was enhanced and is now based on @code{autoconf}
making installing AUC@TeX{} a mostly automatic process.  See
@ref{Installation} and @ref{Installation under MS Windows} for details.
