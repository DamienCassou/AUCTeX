* You are using NeXT Emacs.

NeXT Emacs is broken, a workaround is available by ftp:

host: ftp.emacs.auc.dk
file: /pack/ftp/pub/emacs-lisp/get-proc-env.el.z (gzip'ed)

* Applying style hooks...  is sloooow.

AUC TeX is parsing your file each time you load it.

You can create a subdirectory named `auto' in the directory where you
have your tex files, AUC TeX will then only have to parse the file the
first time you load the file.  It also have the benefit that you get
access to macros, labels, etc. in all the files in a multifile
document from any of the files.

If you don't want this, set TeX-parse-self to nil.  AUC TeX will then
never parse your files.  This will disable many of AUC TeX's features.

* Applying style hooks... is still too slow.

Set the variable TeX-auto-global to nil.  You will then not get
macro expansion for all macros, but AUC TeX will still expand the
standard LaTeX macros.

* C-c C-c has too great a delay.

AUC TeX is searching your current directory as well as your private
TeX macro directories for any files that may have changed.  You can
limit it to the current directory with

	(setq TeX-check-path '("./"))

or disable it entirely with

	(setq TeX-check-path nil)

You can also make it search the global macro directories, so AUC TeX
will suggest "LaTeX" if any of the style files have changed.

	(setq TeX-check-path
	      (append '("./") TeX-macro-private TeX-macro-global))
