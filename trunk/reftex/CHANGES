This is the CHANGES file of the RefTeX distribution, version 4.31 

Here are the more important changes made to RefTeX since initial release.
Minor bug fixes are not mentioned.

Version 4.27
   - Support for jurabib in `reftex-cite-format-builtin'.
   - Bug fixes.

Version 4.26
   - Some improvements for XEmacs compatibilities
   - Support for global incremental search.

Version 4.24
   - Inserting citation commands now prompts for optional arguments
     when called with a prefix argument.  Related new options are
     reftex-cite-prompt-optional-args and reftex-cite-cleanup-optional-args.
   - New option `reftex-trust-label-prefix'.  Configure this variable
     if you'd like RefTeX to base its classification of labels on prefixes.
     This can speed-up document parsing, but may in some cases reduce the
     quality of the context used by RefTeX to describe a label.
   - Fixed bug in `reftex-create-bibtex-file' when `reftex-comment-citations'
     is non-nil.
   - Fixed bugs in indexing: Case-sensitive search, quotes before and/or
     after words.  Disabbled indexing in comment lines.

Version 4.22
   - New command `reftex-create-bibtex-file' to create a new database
     with all entries referenced in the current document.
   - New keys "e" and "E" allow to produce a BibTeX database file
     from entries marked in a Citation selection buffer.

Version 4.21
   - Renaming labels globally from the TOC buffer (key M-%)

Version 4.20
   - Structure editing capabilities.  The command keys "<" and ">" in
     the TOC buffer promote/demote the section at point or all
     sections in the current region.
   - New option `reftex-toc-split-windows-fraction' to set the size of
     the window used by the TOC.  This makes the old variable
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally-fraction' obsolete.
   - A dedicated frame can show the TOC with the current section
     always automatically highlighted.  The frame is created and
     deleted from the toc buffer with the "d" key.

Version 4.19
   - New command reftex-toc-recenter (C-c -) which shows the current
     section in the TOC buffer without selecting the TOC window.
   - Recentering happens automatically in idle time when the option
     `reftex-auto-recenter-toc' is turned on.
   - Fixed several bugs related to cursor positioning in the TOC
     buffer.
   - The highlight in the TOC buffer stays when the focus moves to a
     different window.
   - New command `reftex-goto-label'.
   - Part numbers are no longer included in chapter numbers, and a new
     part does not reset the chapter counter.  See new option
     `reftex-part-resets-chapter'.

Version 4.18
   - `reftex-citation' uses the word before the cursor as a default
     search string.
   - simplified several regular expressions for speed.
   - Better support for chapterbib.  Different chapters can now use
     BibTeX or an explicit `thebibliography' environment.

Version 4.17
   - The toc window can be split off horizontally.  See new options
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally',
     `reftex-toc-split-windows-horizontally-fraction'.
   - It is possible to specify a function which verifies an index match
     during global indexing.  See new option
     `reftex-index-verify-function'.
   - The macros which input a file in LaTeX (like \input, \include) can
     be configured.  See new option `reftex-include-file-commands'.
   - The macros which specify the bibliography file (like
     \bibliography) can be configured.  See new option
     `reftex-bibliography-commands'.
   - The regular expression used to search for the \bibliography macro
     has been relaxed to allow for `{\bibliography{...}}' needed by
     chapterbib.
   - Small bug fixes.

Version 4.15
   - Bug fix in reftex-create-tags-file.
   - Better interaction with Emacs LaTeX mode.

Version 4.14
   - Ensure write access to all files before doing global label replace.
   - Fixed bug which would parse \partial as \part.

Version 4.12
   - Support for `bibentry' citation package.

Version 4.11
   - Fixed bug which would parse \Section as \section.

Version 4.10
   - Renamed `reftex-vcr.el' to `reftex-dcr.el' because of conflict
     with `reftex-vars.el' on DOS machines.
   - New options `reftex-parse-file-extension' and
     `reftex-index-phrase-file-extension'. 

Version 4.09
   - RefTeX maintaines an "Index Phrases" file in which phrases can be 
     collected.  When the document is ready, RefTeX can search all
     these phrases and assist indexing all matches.
   - The variables `reftex-index-macros' and
     `reftex-index-default-macro' have changed their syntax slightly.
     The "repeat" parameter has move from the latter to the former.
     Also calls to `reftex-add-index-macros' from AUCTeX style files
     need to be adapted.
   - The variable `reftex-section-levels' no longer contains the
     default stuff which has been moved to a constant.
   - Environments like theorems can be placed into the TOC by putting
     entries for "begin{theorem}" in `reftex-setion-levels'.
Version 4.07
   - New option `reftex-toc-max-level' to limit the depth of the toc.
     The `t' key in the *toc* and *RefTeX Select* buffers also changes
     this variable.
Version 4.06
   - `reftex-section-levels' can now also contain functions to compute 
     level.
   - Multiple `thebibliography' environments recognized.
Version 4.04
   - New option `reftex-index-default-tag' implements a default for queries.
Version 4.02
   - macros ending in `refrange' are considered to contain references.
   - Index entries made with `reftex-index-selection-or-word' in TeX
     math mode automatically get enclosing `$' to preserve math mode.
     See new option `reftex-index-math-format'.  Requires AUCTeX.
Version 4.01
   - New command `reftex-index-globally' to index a word in many
     places in the document.  Also available from the index buffer with
     the `&' key.
   - The first item in a @code{reftex-label-alist} entry may now also
     be a parser function to do non-standard parsing.
   - `reftex-auto-view-crossref' no longer interferes with
     `pop-up-frames'.
Version 4.00
   Many changes - too much to document them in detail here.  In summary:
   - RefTeX has been split into 11 smaller lisp files.
   - Index support, along with many new user options.
   - The selection of keys for `\ref' and `\cite' now allows to
     select multiple items by marking entries with the `m' key.
   - fancyref.sty support.
Version 3.38
   - `reftex-view-crossref' no longer moves to find a macro.
   - Bug fix for XEmacs selection process.
Version 3.36
   - New value `window' for option `reftex-auto-view-crossref'.
Version 3.35
   - ISO 8859 Latin-1 chars are converted to ASCII to derive better labels.
     This takes back the related changes in 3.34 for safety reasons.
   - Fixed bug with non-existing string-width function in XEmacs.
Version 3.34
   - Additional flag in `reftex-derive-label-parameters' to make only
     lowercase labels (default t).
   - All .rel files have a final newline to avoid queries.
   - Single byte representations of accented European letters (ISO-8859-1)
     are legal in labels.  However, general Mule characters are not.
Version 3.33
   - Multiple Selection Buffers are now hidden (names start with a space).
   - Fixed bug with file search when TEXINPUTS was empty.
Version 3.30
   - In `reftex-citation', the regexp can be completed on known cite keys.
   - New keys `a' and `A' in bib selection process to cite all entries.
   - New command `reftex-renumber-simple-labels' to renumber `eq:13' etc.
Version 3.28
   - Auto view crossref for XEmacs uses post-command-hook to restart the
     timer, since itimer restart is not reliable.
   - Option `reftex-bibfile-ignore-list' renamed to `-regexps'.

     New option `reftex-cache-cite-echo'.
   - `M-x reftex-reset-mode' now also removes the file with parsing info.
   - Default of `reftex-revisit-to-follow' changed to nil.
Version 3.24
   - New option `reftex-revisit-to-echo'.
   - Interface with X-Symbol (>=2.6) is now complete and stable.
   - Adapted to new outline, which uses overlays.
Version 3.23
   - Parse files MASTER.rel made compatible between Emacs and XEmacs.
   - `kill-emacs-hook' and `kill-buffer-hook' now write the parse file.
   - The cursor inside a \ref or \cite macro now triggers automatic
     display of crossref information in the echo area.  See variable
     `reftex-auto-view-crossref'.

Version 3.21
   - New options for all faces used by RefTeX.  They're in the
     customization group `reftex-fontification-configurations'.
Version 3.18

   - Mouse-2 can be used to select in selection and *toc* buffers.

     See new variable `reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers'.
   - Prefix interpretation of reftex-view-crossref changed.
   - Support for the `varioref' package (`v' key in selection buffer).
Version 3.12
