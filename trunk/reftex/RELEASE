Release Notes for RefTeX 4.32 (2007-04-09)
==========================================

RefTeX is a specialized package for support of labels, references,
citations, and the index in LaTeX.  RefTeX wraps itself round four
LaTeX macros: \label, \ref, \cite, and \index.  Using these macros
usually requires looking up different parts of the document and
searching through BibTeX database files.  RefTeX automates these
time-consuming tasks almost entirely.  It also provides functions to
display the structure of a document and to move around in this
structure quickly.

New Features and Bug Fixes
--------------------------

This is the first release of RefTeX after the AUCTeX project took over
maintainership from Carsten Dominik which involved rearranging source
code and putting it under version control.

The installation procedure was reimplemented and the way to activate
RefTeX changed.  So be sure to check out the installation instructions
in the INSTALL file when upgrading because you might have to remove or
replace old commands related to RefTeX from your init file.

Some minor bugs were fixed.  Check the CHANGES file for details.
