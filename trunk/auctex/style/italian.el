;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I believe that the Italian correct quoting is achieved with `«' and
;; `»'.  However, I will be glad to see a normative reference. -- DGMS

;;; Code:

(defvar LaTeX-italian-open-quote "«"
  "Initial value of `TeX-open-quote' for `italian.el'")
(defvar LaTeX-italian-close-quote "»"
  "Initial value of `TeX-close-quote' for `italian.el'")
(defvar TeX-language-it-hook nil
  "Hook run for Italian texts.")

(TeX-add-style-hook
 "italian"
 (lambda ()
   (make-local-variable 'TeX-open-quote)
   (make-local-variable 'TeX-close-quote)
   (setq TeX-open-quote LaTeX-italian-open-quote)
   (setq TeX-close-quote LaTeX-italian-close-quote)
   (run-hooks 'TeX-language-it-hook)))
