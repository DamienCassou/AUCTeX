AUC TeX 
=======

AUC TeX is an Emacs lisp mode for editing TeX and LaTeX documents. 

********** NEWS NEWS NEWS NEWS **********

Version 6:

DOCS!	Preliminary documentation is avilable in the directory
	`doc'.  It isn't very well written, but I beleve it covers
	most interesting points.  Comments, suggestions, or even
	rewrites of sections are VERY WELCOME...

	LaCheck has been incorporated in the package.  The source
	code for it is avilable in the directory `lacheck' along
	with the documentation for it.  Lacheck may also be used 
	from the command line.  It is bound to C-c $.

	Some minor changes in:

	  TeX-region:  Should work better with `Master:' option

	  LaTeX-environment:  Numerous new hooks added by Masayuki
			      Kuwada (hope I spelled it correctly)

	  TeX-command-on-region: removed. C-c C-o used for 
			      outline-minor-mode instead.

	And some additional minor fixes...
