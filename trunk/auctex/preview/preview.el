;; This style is for the "seamless" embedding of generated EPS images
;; into LaTeX source code.  Please see the README and INSTALL files
;; for further instruction.  If you know what you are doing, in a
;; nutshell
;;
;; (autoload 'LaTeX-preview-setup "preview")
;; (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'LaTeX-preview-setup)
;;
;; at the correct location will enable this mode.
;;
;; Please use the usual configure script for installation.
;; Quite a few things with regard to its operation can be configured
;; by using
;; M-x customize-group RET preview RET
;; LaTeX needs to access a special style file "preview.sty".  For the
;; installation of this style file, use the provided configure and
;; INSTALL scripts.
;;
;; Please report bugs with M-x preview-report-bug RET
