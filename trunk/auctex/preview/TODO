Modularize AucTeX's error message parsing
so that we do not need to steal code from AucTeX, but can use
AucTeX's routines directly.  Submit to AucTeX development.

x-symbol compatibility
 Error messages from TeX and buffer contents from the file do not agree
 when x-symbol is active.  That renders the textmath option of the
 preview package mostly useless.  This should be fixed for AucTeX as well.

Fix GhostScript rendering of Emacs
 The current gs.el interface does not work well when multiple EPS
 images appear.  A new process is started for every single image, but
 the processes have to wait for one another.  See also code in
 xdisp.c from the Emacs distribution.

Think about temporary file handling
 The current solution may be suboptimal.  Perhaps a different dvi file
 from the main file would be preferable, perhaps compilation in a
 separate directory, perhaps support for more than one Emacs session
 or user properly accessing the same file.  In all fairness, the
 current _region_ mechanism of AucTeX does not support this, either.

Port to XEmacs
 Very much wanted since we then would get a non-pretest audience for
 preview-latex.

Start documentation
 A texinfo manual would be nice to have.
