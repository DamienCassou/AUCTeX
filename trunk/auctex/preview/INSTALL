Here's how to install preview-latex.  Unlike most packages,
preview-latex consists of a TeX part and an Emacs part.  This makes
configuration a bit trickier than normal.  Please read through this
document fully before installing anything.

Installing preview-latex should be simple: merely ./configure, make,
and make install.

* Prerequisites

** A recent version or pretest of Emacs 21

You need one of the pretest versions of Emacs 21.  Versions 21.0.105
and higher have been tested to work with EPS images, although lower
versions should work with PNG images.  In general, you want the latest
pretest anyway, since preview-latex heavily exercises new features of
Emacs 21, and those naturally are most susceptible to improvements.

** A working AUC-TeX installation

You need a working AUC-TeX installation.  AUC-TeX can be found at
<http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/auctex/www/auctex/>.  All fairly recent
versions should work.

** A working LaTeX installation

Preview should work with nearly any LaTeX installation which contains
dvips, though most testing has taken place using teTeX-based
distributions.

* Configure

The first step is to configure the source code, telling it where
various files will be.  To do so, run

./configure [OPTIONS]

(Note: if you have fetched preview-latex from CVS rather than a
regular release, you will have to first generate ./configure by
running autoconf in the preview directory.)

On many machines, you will not need to specify any options, but if
configure cannot determine something on its own, you'll need to help
it out with one of these options

--with-emacs=/path/to/emacs

  If you are using a pretest which isn't in your $PATH, or configure
  is not finding the right emacs binary, you can specify it with this
  option.

--with-auctex=/dir

  If AUC-TeX is installed in a non-standard location (not in
  site-lisp), use this option to specify the location.

--with-texmf=/dir
--with-preview-dir=/dir

  Both of these options can be used to specify the location to install
  the preview TeX files.  They are not necessary for most TeX
  installs, but may be used if you don't like the directory that configure
  is suggesting.

  You can specify a part of the TeX directory hierarchy with
  --with-texmf=/dir, and the TeX files will be installed in
  /dir/tex/latex/preview.  Use this if you'd like things installed
  in a TDS directory hierarchy.

  Or, you can specify the exact directory the preview TeX files will
  be installed with --with-preview-dir=/dir.  In this case, the files
  will be placed in /dir.

--with-lispdir=/dir
  
  This tells where to install Emacs Lisp files.  Normally, this option
  is unnecessary, but may be used if you don't like the directory that
  configure is suggesting.

* Building files

Once configure has been run, simply enter

  make

at the prompt to byte-compile the lisp files, extract the TeX files
and build the documentation DVI file.

* Installing files

  make install

will install the files into the locations chosen earlier.  You may
need special privileges to install, e.g. if you are installing into
system directories.

* Load it by putting (require 'preview) into your .emacs.  

Be sure to have AucTeX up and working.  C-c C-c g <RET> should then
give you a graphics preview, if you have a statement like
\usepackage[graphics,floats,textmath,displaymath,delayed]{preview} in
your document preamble.  If your preamble does not load the preview
LaTeX package, it will get automatically loaded with a default option
set.  You can customize this default option set and other settings of
the Emacs package by entering
M-x customize-group RET preview RET

* Various configuration issues

You almost certainly want to put (setq gs-device "x11alpha") into your
.emacs file if you want to use Emacs' embedded EPS rendering support
(not the default, however).  This will turn on anti-aliasing.

If you are using GS 6.63 or later, you might try

(require 'gs)
(setq gs-device "x11")
(setq gs-options 
      (append 
       '("-dTextAlphaBits=4" "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=2" "-dMaxBitmap=10000000") 
       gs-options))
which may give better output.

Currently, preview-latex's default mechanism instead calls GhostScript
itself for first rendering all preview images into png format, then
the rendered images get used instead of making use of Emacs' builtin
EPS support.  For this to work, your version of GhostScript needs to
support the png256 device.  Other options are available by using
customize (as mentioned above) on preview-image-type.  The appropriate
type must be supported in the preview-image-creators variable which
you can customize as well, so adding a suitable device or changing an
existing one in a way to better suit the version of GhostScript you
happen to be using should be possible if you take the existing
settings as example.  Please send information about such devices to
the addresses mentioned in the README file so that we can improve
preview-latex.

It might also be necessary to play around with the settings of the
variable preview-gs-options in order to get your version of
GhostScript to work.

There is a sample file circ.tex which you can use for testing around
a bit, and which serves as sort of a reference for initial bug
reports.

* If it does not work

Currently one of the most common problems is GhostScript failing.  We
want to support most reasonable versions of GhostScript, so if you are
experiencing problems, be sure to include the output of "gs -h" in
your report.  If you use M-x preview-report-bug, this should be done
automatically.

A failing run will add information to the bottom of the process buffer
displayed by C-c C-l, or attach the information to the particular
images causing failure.

See the PROBLEMS file for a list of known problems.
