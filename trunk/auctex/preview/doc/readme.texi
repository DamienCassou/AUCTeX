@cindex Readme
@section @previewlatex{} in a nutshell
Does your neck hurt from turning between previewer windows and the
source too often? This Elisp/@LaTeX{} package will render your displayed
@LaTeX{} equations right into the editing window where they belong.

Purpose of @previewlatex{} is to embed @LaTeX{} environments such as
display math or figures into the source buffers.  By mouse-clicking, you
can open the original text.  After editing, another click will just run
the region in question through @LaTeX{} and redisplay the new results.

If @previewlatex{} has not come in the form of a preinstalled package
for you, consult
@ifset rawfile
the @file{INSTALL} file.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@ref{Installation}.
@end ifclear
After the installation, documentation in the form of an info manual will
be available.  You can access it with the standalone info reader with

@example
info preview-latex
@end example
@noindent
or with

@example
@kbd{C-h i d m preview-latex @key{RET}}
@end example
@noindent
from inside Emacs.  Once @previewlatex{} is activated, the
documentation is also available from the @samp{LaTeX/Preview/Read
documentation} menu.

Detailed documentation for the @LaTeX{} style used for extracting the
preview images is placed in @file{preview.dvi} in a suitable directory
during installation; on typical teTeX-based systems,

@example
texdoc preview
@end example
@noindent
will display it.

@cindex Activation
@section Activating @previewlatex{}
After the installation process completes, you need to activate
@previewlatex{} (prepackaged versions might already do that).  The
activation line that needs to be added to your own @file{.emacs} file
or to a site-wide initialization file is

@example
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'LaTeX-preview-setup)
@end example
@noindent
For a well-configured prepackaged version, this should be the all you
need to do.  If you installed @previewlatex{} yourself, at least the
line

@example
(autoload 'LaTeX-preview-setup "preview")
@end example
@noindent
is also needed.  And in case the directory to which the Elisp files have
been installed is not known to Emacs, a line like

@example
(add-to-list 'load-path @var{"/whatever/directory"})
@end example
@noindent
needs to be added, as well.

@section Prerequisites

Currently, @previewlatex{} works with Emacs-21.1.  Due to Emacs' current
lack of image support on those platforms, it will not work on Windows or
on Macintoshes.  We have been using te@TeX{}, but other @TeX{}
distributions containing Dvips are not likely to cause major
difficulties.  You need @AUCTeX{} in version 11.0 or later, which at the
time of this writing means an alpha-test version.  You can get it from
@uref{http://mirrors.sunsite.dk/auctex/www/auctex/}.  A suitable version
also is available from the download site of @previewlatex{}'s home page
(see below).  You need GhostScript, at least version 6.51.

@strong{Please note:} At the current point of time, the port to XEmacs
is progressing, but neither finished nor documented yet.  With the Emacs
port, a lot of work had to be invested for the final polish, making
things work smooth and naturally.  The same is to be expected for
XEmacs.  If you are interested in contributing to this or any other
area, please contact the developers' list mentioned below.

@ifset rawfile
the file @file{PROBLEMS}.

@section Availability
@cindex Download
@cindex @acronym{CVS} access

The @previewlatex{} project is available at Sourceforge.  In addition to
the main source tarball, we provide prebuilt documentation files there
for those lacking a recent enough version of makeinfo, and source and
binary @file{.rpm} files suitable for a recent RedHat system.  See
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex}.

Anonymous @acronym{CVS} is available as well.  See the Sourceforge web
pages for more information.

For developer access, or if you are having access difficulties, ask on
@email{preview-latex-devel@@lists.sourceforge.net} (see below).
