@cindex Readme
Does Your neck hurt from turning between previewer windows and the
source too often? This Elisp/La@TeX{} package will render your displayed
LaTeX equations right into the editing window where they belong.

The purpose of Preview La@TeX{} is to embed La@TeX{} environments such as
display math or figures into the source buffers. By mouse-clicking, you
can open the original text. After editing, another click will just run
the region in question through LaTeX and redisplay the new results.

For installation instructions, see the @file{INSTALL} file or the
identical Installation chapter in the Preview La@TeX{} manual. The LaTeX
style used is documented in a dvi style produced by the installation
process.

@section Prerequisites

Current state of affairs: you need to get access to a version of Emacs
21. The public release 21.1 should be ok for starters. Pretest versions
before that have problems. Direct EPS rendering still is in need of
improvement and very experimental, so the default setting replaces
Emacs' internal EPS handling by an indirect rendering mechanism. If you
feel capable of helping out with Emacs' EPS interface (meaning that the
APIs connecting GhostScript and viewers such as GhostView and xdvi are
not a book with seven seals for you), feel free to do so. Report bugs
you can reproduce along with the files needed to reproduce them. The new
display engine for 21.1 is quite powerful, and some bugs still might be
lurking inside.

You also need AUC @TeX{} installed and working, and probably a fairly
recent version of GhostScript.  At the current point of time, XEmacs
is not supported.  Work is underway to change that in future versions,
contributions would be welcome.

For some known problems with various software, see the file
@file{PROBLEMS}.

@section Availability
@cindex Download
@cindex CVS access

The preview-latex project is available at Sourceforge,
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex}. There, the source
tarball can be downloaded and also a binary .rpm suitable for a recent
RedHat system.

Anonymous CVS is available as well. See the Sourceforge web pages for
more information, but here are the basic instructions (when prompted for
a password for anonymous, simply press the @key{enter} key.)

@example
@iftex
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end iftex 
@ifnottex
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end ifnottex 
@end example

Updates from within the preview directory do not need the -d parameter.
A simple @code{cvs update} from within that directory will make your CVS
mirror up to date again. For developer access, ask on the
@email{preview-latex-devel} list (see below).


@section Contacts
