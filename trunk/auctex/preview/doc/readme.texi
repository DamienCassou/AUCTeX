@cindex Readme
Does your neck hurt from turning between previewer windows and the
source too often? This Elisp/@LaTeX{} package will render your displayed
@LaTeX{} equations right into the editing window where they belong.

The purpose of @previewlatex{} is to embed @LaTeX{} environments such as
display math or figures into the source buffers.  By mouse-clicking, you
can open the original text.  After editing, another click will just run
the region in question through @LaTeX{} and redisplay the new results.

For installation instructions, see the @file{INSTALL} file
(@ref{Installation}).  The @LaTeX{} style used is documented in
@file{preview.dvi} as produced by the installation process.

@section Prerequisites

Most importantly, you need to get access to a version of Emacs 21.  The
public release 21.1 is known to work.  Pretest versions before that have
problems.  You also need @LaTeX{}, of course, but most installs that
includes dvips should work.  A fairly recent @AUCTeX{} is also needed.
You also need a recent Ghostscript, and this is the most common source
of problems.  Version 6.51 is known to work well, whereas earlier
versions have problems.

@strong{Please note:} At the current point of time, the port to XEmacs
is progressing, but neither finished nor documented yet.  With the Emacs
port, a lot of work had to be invested for the final polish, making
things work smooth and naturally.  The same is to be expected for
XEmacs.  If you are interested in contributing to this or any other
area, please contact the developers' list mentioned below.

For some known issues with various software, see the file
@file{PROBLEMS} (@ref{Known problems}).

@section Availability
@cindex Download
@cindex @acronym{CVS} access

The @previewlatex{} project is available at Sourceforge, where the
source tarball can be downloaded and also a binary @file{.rpm}
suitable for a recent RedHat system.  See
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex}.

Anonymous @acronym{CVS} is available as well.  See the Sourceforge web
pages for more information, but here are the basic instructions (when
prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the @key{RET} key).

@example
@iftex
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end iftex 
@ifnottex
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end ifnottex 
@end example

Updates from within the preview directory do not need the @option{-d}
parameter.  A simple @code{cvs update} from within that directory will
make your @acronym{CVS} mirror up to date again.  For developer access,
ask on @email{preview-latex-devel@@lists.sourceforge.net} (see below).
