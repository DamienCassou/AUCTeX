@cindex Readme
Does your neck hurt from turning between previewer windows and the
source too often? This Elisp/La@TeX{} package will render your displayed
La@TeX{} equations right into the editing window where they belong.

The purpose of preview-latex is to embed La@TeX{} environments such as
display math or figures into the source buffers. By mouse-clicking, you
can open the original text. After editing, another click will just run
the region in question through La@TeX{} and redisplay the new results.

For installation instructions, see the @file{INSTALL} file or
@ref{Installation}. The La@TeX{} style used is documented in a dvi style
produced by the installation process.

@section Prerequisites

Most importantly, you need to get access to a version of Emacs 21. The
public release 21.1 is known to work. Pretest versions before that have
problems. You also need La@TeX{}, of course, but most installs that
includes dvips should work. A fairly recent AUC @TeX{} is also needed.
You also need a recent Ghostscript, and this is the most common source
of problems. Version 6.51 is known to work well, whereas earlier
versions have problems.

@strong{Please note:} At the current point of time, XEmacs is not
supported. Work is underway to change that in future versions,
contributions would be welcome.

For some known problems with various software, see the file
@file{PROBLEMS}.

@section Availability
@cindex Download
@cindex @acronym{CVS} access

The preview-latex project is available at Sourceforge, where the source
tarball can be downloaded and also a binary .rpm suitable for a recent
RedHat system. See @url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex}.

Anonymous @acronym{CVS} is available as well. See the Sourceforge web
pages for more information, but here are the basic instructions (when
prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the @key{RET} key.)

@example
@iftex
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
@nobreak @hskip-100pt cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end iftex 
@ifnottex
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.preview-latex.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/preview-latex co preview
@end ifnottex 
@end example

Updates from within the preview directory do not need the @option{-d}
parameter.  A simple @code{cvs update} from within that directory will
make your @acronym{CVS} mirror up to date again. For developer access,
ask on @email{preview-latex-devel@@lists.sourceforge.net} (see below).
