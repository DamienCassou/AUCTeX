@top Preview La@TeX{}
 
Preview La@TeX{} is a package that allows extraction of certain
environments (most notably displayed formulas) for use in different
contexts. While the first application has been the embedding of those
preview fragments into Emacs source buffers under the AUC @TeX{} editing
environment, other applications are easily imaginable.

This file documents Preview La@TeX{} version 0.5.8.2.

If you want to use Preview La@TeX{} in AUC @TeX{} right away, be sure
to have a working AUC @TeX{} installation, install Preview La@TeX{}
and insert the following in your @file{.emacs} file.  This will make
Emacs load preview.el into AUC @TeX{} when you first load a La@TeX{}
file.

@lisp
(autoload 'LaTeX-preview-setup "preview")
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'LaTeX-preview-setup)
@end lisp

NOTE: This documentation is preliminary.  It should however cover most
important points.  Corrections or perhaps rewrites of sections
are VERY WELCOME.

The simplest way to use Preview La@TeX{} is to insert the following in
your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(autoload 'LaTeX-preview-setup "preview")
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'LaTeX-preview-setup)
@end lisp

Now, load a La@TeX{} document, and press @kbd{C-c C-c g RET} (for
``Generate Preview'') or press @kbd{C-c C-p C-p} (for ``De/Preview
This''). Previews will now be generated for various objects in your
document. You'll see them change into a large question-mark when the
process is half finished. Note that you can freely edit the buffer while
this is going on. When the process is finished you will see the objects
typeset in your buffer.

To see/edit the La@TeX{} code for a specific object, put the point (the
cursor) on it and press @kbd{C-c C-p C-p}. Now you can edit the code,
and generate a new preview by again pressing @kbd{C-c C-p C-p}.

@cindex Customization

Customization options can be found by typing @kbd{M-x customize-group
RET preview RET}. The list can be made very long, but some suggestions
are:

@itemize @bullet
@item Adjust the smoothening of the previews

In the @code{Preview Gs} group, change @code{Preview Gs Options}: try
setting @code{-dGraphicsAlphaBits=2}, for instance.

@item Change the color of the preview background

If you use a non-white background in emacs, it is possible to make the
previews have the same background color. In the @code{Preview
Appearance} group, set @code{Preview Transparent Color} to
@code{Autodetect}. This will also make the point (the cursor) cover the
whole background of a preview, but you'll have to live with that.

@item Preview inline math

In the @code{Preview Latex} group, check the box next to @code{textmath}
in @code{Preview Default Option List}.  Beware if you use
@code{x-symbol}, there is a known issue with that package.

@item The @code{showkeys} package

When using preview-latex, the \labels are hidden by the previews. To
show them in the previews (yes, this is possible) use the La@TeX{}
package @code{showkeys}, by changing @code{Preview Latex Command} in the
@code{Preview Latex} group to include @code{\usepackage@{showkeys@}} in
between @code{\AtBeginDocument@{} and @code{\ifx\ifPreview\undefined}

@chapter Internals/more customization

This package consists of two parts. A La@TeX{} style that splits the
output into appropriate parts with one preview object on each page, and
an emacs-lisp part integrating the thing into emacs (aided by AUC
@TeX{}).

@section The emacs interface

When you generate previews on a buffer or a region, the command in
@code{preview-LaTeX-command} gets run (that variable should only be
changed with @code{M-x customize RET} so that changes get propagated to
AUC @TeX{}'s command list).

This command passes options @code{auctex} and @code{active} to the
preview package so that the user need not supply these by himself in
case he wants to be able to still compile his document without it
turning into an incoherent mass of little pictures. It also tells LaTeX
to load the preview package with the options configured in
@code{preview-default-option-list} if the document does not call in the
package itself (via @code{\usepackage}) in the preamble.

This run produces a dvi file where every preview is on a separate page.
As usual with AUC @TeX{}, you can continue editing while this is going
on. It produces a host of pseudo-error messages that get parsed by
preview-latex at the end of the La@TeX{} run and give it the necessary
information about where in the source file the La@TeX{} code for the
various previews is located exactly. The parsing takes a moment and will
render Emacs busy. Before Emacs starts the parsing of the error
messages, it starts conversion of the previews into PostScript EPS
files, by calling the configurable @code{preview-dvips-command}. The
printer specified in there is @code{-Pwww} by default, which will
usually get you scalable fonts where available. If you are experiencing
problems, you might want to try playing around with dvips options
(hyperlink to dvips info file?).

When Emacs has finished parsing the error messages, it activates all
detected previews.  This entails throwing away any previous previews
covering the same areas, and then replacing the text in its visual
appearance by a placeholder looking like a question mark.

What happens when dvips is finished depends on the configuration of
@code{preview-image-type}. If this is set to @code{'postscript},
preview-latex will simply tell Emacs about where it can find the EPS
files for each image and will then be finished. Emacs runs GhostScript
whenever it finds it needs to have one image displayed. It turns out
that at the time of writing, the implementation in Emacs causes this to
make editing painfully slow and non-responsive. This is because Emacs
starts one GhostScript process per image. For this reason,
@code{preview-image-type} defaults to @code{'png}. This makes
preview-latex start up a single GhostScript process on its own and feeds
it the various EPS files in sequence for conversion into PNG format
which can be displayed much faster by Emacs. Actually, not in sequence
but backwards since you are most likely editing at the end of the
document. And as an added convenience, any preview that happens to be
on-screen is given higher priority so that preview-latex will first
cater for the images that are displayed. There are various options
customizable concerning aspects of that operation, see the customization
group @code{preview-gs} for this.

Running and feeding GhostScript from preview-latex happens
asynchronously again: you can resume editing while the images arrive.
While those pretty pictures filling in the blanks on screen tend to
make one marvel instead of work, rendering the non-displayed images
afterwards will not take away your attention and will eventually
guarantee that jumping around in the document will encounter only
prerendered images.

@section On EPS previews

@vindex @code{preview-image-type}
@vindex @code{preview-image-creators}
As mentioned above, preview-latex's default mechanism calls GhostScript
itself for first rendering all preview images into png format, then the
rendered images get used instead of making use of Emacs' builtin EPS
support. For this to work, your version of GhostScript needs to support
the png256 device. Other options are available by customizing
@code{preview-image-type}. The appropriate type must be supported in the
@code{preview-image-creators} variable which you can customize as well,
so adding a suitable device or changing an existing one in a way to
better suit the version of GhostScript you happen to be using should be
possible if you take the existing settings as example. Please send
information about such devices to the addresses mentioned in the README
file so that we can improve preview-latex.

IF you want to use Emacs' embedded EPS rendering support (which is NOT
the default), you almost certainly want to put @code{(setq gs-device
"x11alpha")} into your @file{.emacs} file. This will turn on
anti-aliasing.

If you are using GS 6.63 or later, you may get better output using the
following.
@vindex @code{gs-device}
@vindex @code{gs-options}

@lisp
(require 'gs)
(setq gs-device "x11")
(setq gs-options 
      (append 
       '("-dTextAlphaBits=4" 
         "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=2" 
         "-dMaxBitmap=10000000") 
       gs-options))

@node Misplaced previews,  , The emacs interface, Internals
@section Misplaced previews

As explained previously, Emacs uses pseudo-error messages generated by
the preview.sty package in order to pinpoint the exact source location
where a preview originated. This works in running text, but fails when
preview material happens to lie in macro arguments, like the contents of
@code{\emph}. Those macros first read in their entire argument, munge it
through, perhaps transform it somehow, process it and perhaps then
typeset something. When they finally typeset something, where is the
location where the stuff originated? @TeX, having read in the entire
argument before, does not know and actually there would be no sane way
of defining it. 

For previews contained inside such a macro argument, the default
behaviour of preview-latex is to use a position immediately after the
closing brace of the argument. All the prewiews get placed there, all at
a zero-width position, which means that emacs displays it in an order
that preview-latex cannot influence (currently in emacs it is even
possible that the order changes between runs). And since the placement
of those previews is goofed up, you will not be able to regenerate them
by clicking on them. The default behaviour is thus somewhat undesirable.

The solution (like with other preview problems) is to tell the LaTeX
preview package how to tackle this problem. You know the
@code{\PreviewMacro} command explained above (cough, cough). There is a
variant @code{\PreviewMacro*} and its cousin @code{\PreviewEnvironment*}
that do just the opposite. @code{\PreviewMacro\somecommand} puts the
entire @code{\somecommand} in one box to be previewed. For macros like
@code{\emph} this is pretty inappropriate since the result for a larger
passage gets unwieldy for display and editing. But you don't need
@code{\emph} do anything at all during previews! So the solution is to
use \code{\PreviewMacro*\emph} in the preamble of your document which
will make La@TeX ignore @code{\emph} completely as long as it is not part of a
larger preview (in which case it gets typeset as usual). Its argument
thus becomes ordinary text and gets treated like ordinary text. 

Note that it would be a bad idea to declare
@code{\PreviewMacro*[{{}}]\emph} since then both @code{\emph} as well as
its argument would be ignored instead of previewed. For user-level
macros, this is almost never wanted, but there may be internal macros
where you might want to ignore internal arguments.

The same mechanism can be used for a number of other text-formatting
commands like @code{\textrm}, @code{\textit} and the like. While they
all use the same internal macro @code{\text@@command}, it will not do to
redefine just that, since they call it only after having read their
argument in, and then it already is too late. So you need to disable
every of those commands by hand in your document preamble.

(To add here: the new preview-default-preamble (will) contain common
cases)
