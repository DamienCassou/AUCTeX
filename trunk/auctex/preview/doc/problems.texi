@node Problems with GhostScript, Font problems with Dvips, , Known problems
@section Problems with GhostScript

Most of the problems encountered come from interaction with GhostScript.
It is a good idea to have a fairly recent version of GhostScript
installed.  In particular, the device names have changed over time,
so you should check that the devices demanded by the customizable
variable @code{preview-image-creators} fit your version of GhostScript,
at least the entry corresponding to the current value of
@code{preview-image-type}.  While not being best in file size and image
quality, setting @code{preview-image-creators} to @code{jpeg} should
probably be one of the best bets, since that device name has not changed
in quite some time.

When GhostScript fails, the necessary information and messages from
Ghostscript go somewhere.  If GhostScript fails before starting to
process images, you'll find the information at the end of the process
buffer you can see with @kbd{C-c C-l}.  If GhostScript fails while
processing a particular image, this image will be tagged with clickable
buttons for the error description and for the corresponding source file.

The default options configurable with

@display
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} preview-gs-options @key{RET}}
@end display
@noindent
include the options @option{-dTextAlphaBits=4} and
@option{-dGraphicsAlphaBits=4}.  These options have been reported to
make GhostScript 5.50 fail, but should work under GhostScript 6.51 and
later.  If you are experiencing problems, it might help to customize
them away.  Of course, this also takes away the joy of antialiasing, so
upgrading GhostScript might not be the worst idea after all.

@node Font problems with Dvips, Emacs problems, Problems with GhostScript, Known problems
@section Font problems with Dvips
Some fonts have been reported to produce wrong characters with
@previewlatex{}.  @previewlatex{} calls Dvips by default with the option
@option{-Pwww} in order to get scalable fonts for nice results.  If you
are using antialiasing, however, the results might be sufficiently nice
with bitmapped fonts, anyway.  You might try @option{-Ppdf} for another
stab at scalable fonts, or other printer definitions.  Use

@display
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} preview-fast-dvips-command @key{RET}}
@end display
@noindent
and
@display
@kbd{M-x customize-variable @key{RET} preview-dvips-command @key{RET}}
@end display
@noindent
in order to customize this.

One particular problem is that several printer setup files (typically in
a file called @file{/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.pdf} if you are
using the @option{-Ppdf} switch) contain the @option{G} option for
`character shifting'.  This option will result in @samp{fi} being
rendered as @samp{@pounds{}} (British Pounds sign) in several fonts.

@itemize @bullet
@item GNU Emacs versions prior to 21.1

Don't use them.  20.x will not work, 21.0.x were prereleases, anyway.

@item GNU Emacs under Windows operating systems

As of GNU Emacs 21.2, no image support is available in Emacs under
Windows.  Without images, @previewlatex{} is useless.  The current
@acronym{CVS} version of Emacs available from
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs} now is supposed to support
images, so it is likely that @w{Emacs 21.4} will have a reasonable
chance of working once it is out.  If it is important to you and you
have the necessary technical skills, support the Emacs developer crew by
checking out the current version and trying to get @previewlatex{} to
run on it.  Reasonable patches necessary to make @previewlatex{} work
under Windows will gladly be accepted.  Another option for Windows users
might be to try XEmacs.  One user reported success for the Cygwin port
of XEmacs, after outcommenting the three lines concerning
@code{balloon-help-mode} in @code{preview-mode-setup} in the file
@file{prv-xemacs.el}.  It would appear that this mode is broken under
Windows in some XEmacs versions.

@item XEmacs

XEmacs support should now work.  There is one current problem known with
the XEmacs core, which leads to seriously mispositioned baselines and
previews hanging far above other text on the same line. An alpha-quality
patch against XEmacs-21.4.6 to fix this is available from
@uref{http://list-archive.xemacs.org/xemacs-patches/200204/msg00129.html}.
This patch may be included in XEmacs-21.4.8, but won't be present in any
earlier version.

Previews will only remain from one session to the next if you have
version 1.81 or above of the @file{edit-utils} package, first released
in the 2002-03-12 sumo tarball.

The package hasn't been tested under either the native build for
Windows: if you try it and it works, please say!  For the Cygwin
status, see above.

This support is very new and still changing frequently. Please test it
and report any problems you may be experiencing.

@node AUC TeX prior to 11.0, Too small bounding boxes, Emacs problems, Known problems
@section @AUCTeX{} prior to 11.0

@AUCTeX{} versions up to and including 10.0g have a bug in the
calculation of the offsets for the start of a region.  This affects
@kbd{C-c C-r} commands where the start of the region does not lie on the
start of a line.  It also affects regeneration of single previews.  To
correct this, apply the patch in @file{patches/auctex-10.patch}.  It
might be more prudent to install a more recent version of @AUCTeX{},
however.

@node Too small bounding boxes, LaTeX international characters, AUC TeX prior to 11.0, Known problems
@section Too small bounding boxes
The bounding box of a preview is determined by the @LaTeX{} package
using the pure @TeX{} bounding boxes.  If there is material extending
outside of the @TeX{} box, that material will be missing from the
preview image. For example this happens for the label-showing boxes from
the @code{showkeys} package (which has its own variant in
@previewlatex{}). Should this happen to you, try setting
@code{preview-fast-conversion} to `Off' 
@ifset rawfile
(see the manual).
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
(@pxref{The Emacs interface}).
@end ifclear
The conversion will take slightly more time, but instead
use the bounding boxes from the @acronym{EPS} files generated by Dvips.

Dvips generally does not miss things, but it does not understand
PostScript constructs like @code{\resizebox} or @code{\rotate} commands,
so will generate rather wrong boxes for those.  Dvips can be helped with
the @code{psfixbb} package option to preview 
@ifset rawfile
(see the manual),
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
(@pxref{The LaTeX style file}),
@end ifclear
which will tag the corners of the included @TeX{} box.  This will mostly
be convenient for @emph{pure} PostScript stuff like that created by
PStricks, which Dvips would otherwise reserve no space for.

@node LaTeX international characters, x-symbol interoperation, Too small bounding boxes, Known problems
@section @LaTeX{} international characters

To determine the position of a preview, @previewlatex{} correlates
error messages from @TeX{} with the input text.  The delivered example
file @file{circ.tex} contains @samp{ISO-8859-1} input characters (also
called @samp{Latin-1}).  If your language environment is not properly
set up, or your @TeX{} version is rather old, @TeX{} will, for
example, display @samp{@"u} (German u-Umlaut) as @samp{^^fc}.  In that
case the correlation will fail, with the result that the preview
images get misplaced.  Personally, I have set the environment variable
@env{LANG} to the string @code{en_US.ISO8859-1}.  Your system may have
different ways of achieving something similar.  If you have a
graphical login screen, chances are that it offers a @samp{Language}
setting.  It may help to choose @samp{US English} or similar instead
of the plain @samp{English} setting.  This problem has also been
reported as being caused by te@TeX{} compiled against @samp{libc5}
libraries.

@code{configure} currently tries checking for an 8-bit-clean
configuration of @LaTeX{} and refuses to continue until you have fixed
it.  If nothing else works and you would not need to have an 8-bit
clean installation, pass the option @code{--disable-8bit-test} to
configure.  This will usually result in @file{circ.tex} and other files
with 8-bit characters not being properly previewed.

As a very last resort, when all of the regular attempts of getting your
system recognized as being able to deal with 8-bit characters by the
@code{latex} executable fail, you might try to use @kbd{M-x
customize-variable} on the variable @code{LaTeX-command-style} and
replace the command @code{latex} with @code{latex
-translate-file=cp8bit}.

@node x-symbol interoperation, Middle-clicks paste instead of toggling, LaTeX international characters, Known problems
@section x-symbol interoperation

Thanks to the work of Christoph Wedler, starting with version
@samp{4.0h/beta} of x-symbol, the line parsing of @AUCTeX{} and
@previewlatex{} is fully supported.  Earlier versions exhibit problems.
However, versions before 4.2.2 will cause a drastic slowdown of
@previewlatex{}'s parsing pass, so we don't recommend to use versions
earlier than that.

If you wonder what x-symbol is, it is a package that transforms various
tokens and subscripts to a more readable form while editing and offers a
few input methods handy especially for dealing with math. Take a look at
@uref{http://x-symbol.sourceforge.net}.

@node Middle-clicks paste instead of toggling,  , x-symbol interoperation, Known problems
@section Middle-clicks paste instead of toggling

This is probably the fault of your favorite package.  In Emacs-21.1, the
following culprits are known; Emacs-21.2 inherits those bugs, as of
21.3, they will be fixed.  The patches have been thoroughly tested and
applying them is hardly likely to cause any adverse effect.

@itemize @bullet
@item flyspell.el

Apply the patch in @file{patches/flyspell.patch}.

@item mouse-drag.el

Apply the patch in @file{patches/mouse-drag.patch}.

@item isearch.el

This is one complicated mess to dig through.  Better just end the search
with @kbd{@key{RET}} before toggling and resume with @kbd{C-s C-s} or
similar afterwards.  Since previews over the current match will
auto-open, anyway, this should not be much of a problem.
