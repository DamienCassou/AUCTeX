I do not know where to start.  This is the preview-latex project at
Sourceforge, <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.
There is a mailing list for developers, the web page is
<URL:http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/preview-latex-devel>
Send a message with just the word `help' as subject or body to
    preview-latex-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net
for more information.

Purpose of the package is to embed LaTeX environments such as display
math or figures into the source buffers.  By mouse-clicking, you can
open the original text.  After editing, another click will just run
the region in question through LaTeX and redisplay the new results.

Thr project is just starting.  Current state of affairs: you need to
get access to an Emacs version that is at least 21.0.105, which at the
current time means that you need to be a pretester of Emacs.  Versions
before that have EPS rendering support that is defective.  The current
version of EPS support is just a hack and workaround with a side
effect of sluggish response time, feel free to help the Emacs
development crew in producing something better.  The really bad thing
is the busy-wait in gs.el for a deletion of the display properties
used for passing parameters to GhostScript.  If that could be
eliminated, it would be a boon.  Even 21.0.105 will exhibit occasional
display engine quirks.  Report bugs you can reproduce along with the
files needed to reproduce them.  The new display engine for 21.1 is
quite powerful, and some bugs still might be lurking inside.

Here is what currently works: 

* Run ./configure to create the makefile.  If it can't find your emacs
  or texmf tree, use the --with-emacs=/opt/bin/emacs or
  --with-texmf=/usr/lib/texmf flags.

* Call make to generate sty and elc files.

* make install to install TeX and Emacs Lisp files.

* Load it by putting (require 'preview) into your .emacs.  

Be sure to have AucTeX up and working.  C-c C-c g <RET> should then
give you a graphics preview, if you have a statement like
\usepackage[graphics,floats,textmath,displaymath,delayed]{preview} in
your document preample.

You almost certainly want to put (setq gs-device "x11alpha") into your
.emacs file.  This will turn on anti-aliasing.

If you are using GS 6.63 or later, you might try

(require 'gs)
(setq gs-device "x11")
(setq gs-options 
      (append 
       '("-dTextAlphaBits=4" "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=2" "-dMaxBitmap=10000000") 
       gs-options))

which may give better output.

For more info, read preview.dvi which gets generated by calling make.

I included a sample file circ.tex which you can use for testing around
a bit, and which serves as sort of a reference for initial bug
reports.

Help out!
