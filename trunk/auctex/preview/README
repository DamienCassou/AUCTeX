I do not know where to start.  This is the preview-latex project at
Sourceforge, <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.
There is a mailing list for developers, the web page is
<URL:http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/preview-latex-devel>
Send a message with just the word `help' as subject or body to
    preview-latex-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net
for more information.

Thr project is just starting.  Current state of affairs: you need to
get access to an Emacs version that is at 21.0.105, which at the
current time means that you need to be a pretester of Emacs.  Versions
before that have EPS rendering support that is defective.  The current
version of EPS support is just a hack and workaround with a side
effect of sluggish response time, feel free to help the Emacs
development crew in producing something better.  The really bad thing
is the busy-wait in gs.el for a deletion of the display properties
used for passing parameters to GhostScript.  If that could be
eliminated, it would be a boon.  Even 21.0.105 will exhibit occasional
display engine quirks.  Report bugs you can reproduce along with the
files needed to reproduce them.  The new display engine for 21.1 is
quite powerful, and some bugs still might be lurking inside.

Here is what currently works: edit Makefile to match your docstrip.cfg
file.  Call make.  make preview.el accessible to Emacs.  Load it by
putting (require 'preview) into your .emacs.  Be sure to have AucTeX
up and working.  C-c C-c g <RET> should then give you a graphics
preview, if you have a statement like
\usepackage[graphics,floats,textmath,displaymath,delayed]{preview}
in your document preample.

For more info, read preview.dvi which gets generated by calling make.

I included a sample file circ.tex which you can use for testing around
a bit, and which serves as sort of a reference for initial bug
reports.

Help out!
