Release notes for version 0.6.1 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex is a system for displaying inline images of selected
parts of a file in Emacs source buffers.  It is released under the GNU
Public License (GPL).  At the current point of time, GNU Emacs-21.1,
AUC TeX, a working LaTeX installation and GhostScript are required.
XEmacs support has been intermittedly worked on.  If you are planning
on contributing, please contact the developers' list.  Due to missing
image support of Emacs-21.1 under Microsoft Windows, this platform is
not usable at the current point of time, either.

Release focus have been user interface improvements and documentation.
The TeXinfo documentation now also contains instructions for the used
LaTeX style, and users of Emacs' desktop package will have previews
survive into their next Emacs session.  The LaTeX style now has an
option for making TeX bounding boxes known to Dvips in case there is
a disagreement (frequent with packages like PStricks).

User feedback about errors and suggested feature improvements is
welcome and heeded.  The home page is
<URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net>, the SourceForge project
page that among others offers anonymous CVS access is located at
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.

For users of RedHat linux, a RPM is provided at Sourceforge primarily
for RH 7.x. The RPM requires a few packages:

* GhostScript 6.51 is included in RH 7.2, but if you use an earlier
  release it can be downloaded from the RH7.2 updates,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386/>

* AUC TeX can be found at several places, but if you want the latest
  11.11 (alpha, but stable AFAIK) with no known issues concerning
  preview-latex, an RPM can be found at the project homepage.

* Finally, Emacs-21.1 can be downloaded from rawhide,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/>.
  I installed this using 'rpm -i --nodeps --force', which worked for
  me, but since it does not follow the usual emacs + emacs-X11 +
  emacs-nox, YMMV.
