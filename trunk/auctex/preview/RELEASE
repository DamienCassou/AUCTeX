Release notes for version 0.5.8.3 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex is a system for displaying inline images of selected
parts of a file in Emacs source buffers.  It is released under the GNU
Public License (GPL).  At the current point of time, GNU Emacs-21.1,
Auc-TeX, a working LaTeX installation and GhostScript are required.
XEmacs support is not yet operative, and contributions would be
welcome.  Due to missing image support of Emacs-21.1 under Microsoft
Windows, this platform is not usable at the current point of time,
either.

Release focus are mostly user interface improvements.  Main point has
been an attempt to refrain from disabling previews unless the text
under it has indeed changed and not just been replaced by something
identical or decorated with font-lock.  This makes preview-latex
behave better when filling paragraphs, for example.  Menu entries for
clearing out previews again have been added, and temporary directories
are removed when leaving Emacs.  A TeXinfo manual has been started.

User feedback about errors and suggested feature improvements is
welcome and heeded.  The home page is

page that among others offers anonymous CVS access is located at
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.
