Release notes for version 0.9 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex makes LaTeX a tightly integrated component of your
editing workflow by visualizing selected source chunks (such as single
formulas or graphics) directly as images in the Emacs/XEmacs buffer.
You get to have your eye candy and edit it, too.

The employed style file `preview.sty' is independently useful for
extraction of selected text elements as images.  EPS Graphics that
were created using dvips can now be used with the `tightpage' option,
and some new commands and options are available for selecting
previews.

The package is released under the GNU Public License (GPL).  At the
current point of time, at least GNU Emacs-21.1 under the X window
system or XEmacs-21 in version 21.4.10 or later, AUCTeX (11.51 or
later required for PDF support), a working LaTeX installation and
GhostScript are required.  dvipng (version 1.4 or later), a very fast
dvi converter, can also be used for conversion.  For Windows, MacOS
Carbon or native GTK+ toolkit support, a developer version of GNU
Emacs (to be released as 22.1) is definitely required; for other
platforms, use of it is advantageous.

This version finally gets rid of all 8bit issues that plagued
cooperation with several TeX distributions, and will also support
utf-8 input files.  X-Symbol (as of 4.5.1-beta) will still require an
8bit-transparent TeX executable.

The `README' file provides adequate information for firing up
preinstalled distributions, and pointers how to provide feedback.  The
`INSTALL' file contains a special section with advice for package
providers.  There is also a file `INSTALL.windows' detailing
instructions for users of that operating system.

The home page is <URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net>, the
SourceForge project page that among others offers anonymous CVS access
is located at <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.
However, development and CVS access are scheduled to be folded into
the AUCTeX project (located at Savannah) shortly after this release.
