Release notes for version 0.9 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex dresses up your LaTeX source by pasting judiciously
selected chunks (such as single formulas) chopped from unwieldy
preview pages right over their source in the Emacs/XEmacs buffer.  You
get to have your eye candy and edit it, too.

The employed style file `preview.sty' is independently useful for
extraction of selected text elements as images.  It now fully supports
pdftex including the `tightpage' option.

The package is released under the GNU Public License (GPL).  At the
current point of time, at least GNU Emacs-21.1 under the X window
system or XEmacs-21 in version 21.4.10 or later, AUCTeX (11.14 or
later recommended, see below), a working LaTeX installation and
GhostScript are required.  dvipng (version 1.4 or later), a very fast
dvi converter available from the same CVS archive, can also be used
for conversion.  Recent CVS versions of GNU Emacs for Windows or MacOS
Carbon should also work.

This version finally gets rid of all 8bit-cleanness issues that
plagued cooperation with several TeX distributions, though cooperation
with current versions of X-Symbol (4.5.1-beta) still requires
8bit-cleanliness until the fixes get incorporated there.  But
preview-latex does no longer check for this.  utf-8 buffers are now
also supported.

The `README' file provides adequate information for firing up
preinstalled distributions, and pointers how to provide feedback.  The
`INSTALL' file contains a special section with advice for package
providers.  There is also a file `INSTALL.windows' detailing
instructions for users of that operating system.
