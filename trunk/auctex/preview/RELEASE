Release notes for version 0.7.1 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex is a system for displaying inline images of selected
parts of a file in Emacs source buffers.  The employed style file
preview.sty is independently useful for extraction of selected text
elements as images.  The package is released under the GNU Public
License (GPL).  At the current point of time, GNU Emacs-21 under the X
window system, AUC TeX, a working LaTeX installation and GhostScript
are required.  This version for the first time also fully supports
XEmacs with a version of at least 21.1.  Some issues with the display
engine have been uncovered in the course of porting; consult the
PROBLEMS file for more information.  No versions have been tested to
run under the MS Windows operating system.  Recent CVS versions of
Emacs could possibly be made to run preview-latex there, and we have
had a positive report with Cygwin XEmacs.  Please report your
experiences.

Release focus for 0.7 have been documentation improvements, staggering
performance enhancements, better error handling and new features.  For
the first time, workable XEmacs support is included.  The LaTeX style
has gained a load of new options.  It is now possible to generate all
image files for a document with a single run of GhostScript on a
single PostScript file from Dvips.  Release 0.7.1 fixes various issues
under XEmacs including an installation problem, and offers some
additional performance enhancements.

The README file has been changed in order to provide adequate
information for preinstalled distributions.  In that case, including
the separate INSTALL file will not be necessary.

User feedback about errors and suggested feature improvements is
welcome and heeded.  The home page is
<URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net>, the SourceForge project
page that among others offers anonymous CVS access is located at
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.

Additional files can be found at
<URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/preview-latex>:

* If you don't have texinfo 4.0 or later installed, prebuilt
  documentation files can be found there.

* AUC TeX can be found at several places, but if you want the latest
  11.11 (alpha, but stable AFAIK) with no known issues concerning
  preview-latex, you can find it there as well.

* RPMs for preview-latex and AUC TeX are provided for users of RedHat
  Linux.  For the binary RPMs, you will need the preview-latex-common
  RPM as well as the Emacs-flavor specific RPM.

The RPMs require a few packages:

* GhostScript 6.51 is included in RH 7.2, but if you use an earlier
  release it can be downloaded from the RH7.2 updates,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386/>.
  The current beta of RedHat 7.3 (see below) includes GhostScript 6.53.

* Emacs-21.2 is part of the beta release for RedHat 7.3 at
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/beta/skipjack/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/>
  unless it has already been superceded by the regular release.
  I installed this using 'rpm -i --nodeps --force', which worked for
  me, but since it does not follow the usual emacs + emacs-X11 +
  emacs-nox, YMMV.
