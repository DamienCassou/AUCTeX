Release notes for version 0.6 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex is a system for displaying inline images of selected
parts of a file in Emacs source buffers.  It is released under the GNU
Public License (GPL).  At the current point of time, GNU Emacs-21.1,
AUC TeX, a working LaTeX installation and GhostScript are required.
XEmacs support is not yet operative, and contributions would be
welcome.  Due to missing image support of Emacs-21.1 under Microsoft
Windows, this platform is not usable at the current point of time,
either.

Release focus is user interface improvements and documentation. Main
point has been an attempt to refrain from disabling previews unless
the text under it has indeed changed and not just been replaced by
something identical or decorated with font-lock. This makes
preview-latex behave better when filling paragraphs, for example. Menu
entries for clearing out previews again have been added, and temporary
directories are removed when leaving Emacs. A TeXinfo manual has been
started.

User feedback about errors and suggested feature improvements is
welcome and heeded.  The home page is
<URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net>, the SourceForge project
page that among others offers anonymous CVS access is located at
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.


For users of RedHat linux, a RPM is provided at the above site
primarily for RH 7.x. The RPM requires a few packages:

* GhostScript 6.51 is included in RH 7.2, but if you use an earlier
  release it can be downloaded from the RH7.2 updates,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386/>

* AUC TeX 10.0g can be found at rhcontrib, see
  <URL:http://rhcontrib.bero.org/RPMS/i386/>, note that you need both
  auctex-10.0g-4.i386.rpm and auctex-emacs-10.0g-4.i386.rpm, the
  package is split. I had to use '--nodeps' when installing, but it
  does work after that.

* Finally, Emacs-21.1 can be downloaded from rawhide,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS/>.
  I installed this using 'rpm -i --nodeps --force', which worked for
  me, but since it does not follow the usual emacs + emacs-X11 +
  emacs-nox, YMMV.
