Release notes for version 0.7.4 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex dresses up your LaTeX source by placing right into its
Emacs/XEmacs buffer judiciously selected chunks (such as single
formulas) chopped from unwieldy preview pages, while keeping the
original source readily accessible.  You get to have your eye candy
and edit it, too.

The employed style file preview.sty is independently useful for
extraction of selected text elements as images.  The package is
released under the GNU Public License (GPL).  At the current point of
time, at least GNU Emacs-21.1 under the X window system, AUC TeX
(11.11 recommended, see below), a working LaTeX installation and
GhostScript are required.  This version also supports XEmacs-21, best
in version 21.4.9 or later.  Under the Windows operating system, we
have had positive reports for both native and Cygwin ports of XEmacs.
Recent CVS versions of GNU Emacs could conceivably be made to run
preview-latex under Windows, but we have had no reports for this
combination yet.

Release 0.7.4 is a consolidation release containing mostly bug fixes.
The quest to work around broken security implementations of
GhostScript hopefully has lead to safer and more reliable results.
Under GNU Emacs, preview-at-point has been added to the tool-bar.

The previous release lead to problems when buffers without associated
file name were put into LaTeX-mode.  If this occured while first
loading preview-latex, compatibility macros caused further problems
with various other packages in XEmacs.

The README file provides adequate information for firing up
preinstalled distributions, and pointers how to provide feedback.  The
INSTALL file contains a special section with advice for package
providers.

SourceForge project page that among others offers anonymous CVS access
is located at <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.

Additional files can be found at
<URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/preview-latex>:

* If you don't have texinfo 4.0 or later installed, prebuilt
  documentation files can be found there.

* AUC TeX can be found at several places, but if you want the latest
  11.11 (alpha, but stable AFAIK) with no known issues concerning
  preview-latex, you can find it there as well.

* RPMs for preview-latex and AUC TeX are provided for users of RedHat
  Linux.  For the binary RPMs, you will need the preview-latex-common
  RPM as well as the Emacs-flavor specific RPM.

The RPMs require a few packages that should be readily available in
current distributions.  RedHat 7.3 contains Emacs-21.2 and
GhostScript-6.52 which are about the minimum versions to be
recommended.  Later releases should work fine.  XEmacs in current
distributions will still be affected with a serious display bug, see
the PROBLEMS file or the respective manual section.
