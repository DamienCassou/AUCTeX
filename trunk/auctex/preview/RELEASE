Release notes for version 0.7.3 of the preview-latex package:

preview-latex could be the greatest thing since sliced bread, were it
not just the same.  Sliced bread provides you with a handle on
conveniently sized chunks of the real matter as well as unhampered
creative freedom for the space in between.  It obliterates the
unwieldy handling of loaf-sized chunks and puts the bread right on
your plate where it belongs.  preview-latex similarly chops unwieldy
pages of subpixel-accurate LaTeX previews into handily sized fully
dressed chunks (such as single formulas) that get placed right into
your Emacs/XEmacs source buffer, freeing the desktop space otherwise
required for separate carving plates, while keeping the original
source readily accessible.  You get to have your eye candy and edit
it, too.

The employed style file preview.sty is independently useful for
extraction of selected text elements as images.  The package is
released under the GNU Public License (GPL).  At the current point of
time, at least GNU Emacs-21.1 under the X window system, AUC TeX
(11.11 recommended, see below), a working LaTeX installation and
GhostScript are required.  This version also supports XEmacs-21.  For
best results, at least version 21.4.9 is recommended since it
incorporates several fixes necessary for proper operation of
preview-latex.  Under the Windows operating system, we have had
positive reports for both native and Cygwin ports of XEmacs.  Recent
CVS versions of GNU Emacs could conceivably be made to run
preview-latex under Windows, but we have had no reports for this
combination yet.

Release 0.7.3 is a consolidation release containing mostly bug fixes.
It has to disable a broken security implementation that persists into
version 7.05 of GNU GhostScript.  If security of third-party generated
DVI/PostScript is an issue for you, at the current point of time you
will have to resort to an AFPL GhostScript release.

One new feature is dumping of precompiled preambles in order to
facilitate faster regeneration of previews.  You can do this via a key
combination or from the `Preview' menu which has been moved to the
menu bar from the `LaTeX' menu.  This further improves the already
impressive performance even on bottom-line computers.

The README file provides adequate information for preinstalled
distributions.  The INSTALL file contains a special section with
advice for package providers.

User feedback about errors and suggested feature improvements is
welcome and heeded.  The home page is
<URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net>, the SourceForge project
page that among others offers anonymous CVS access is located at
<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/preview-latex>.

Additional files can be found at
<URL:http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/preview-latex>:

* If you don't have texinfo 4.0 or later installed, prebuilt
  documentation files can be found there.

* AUC TeX can be found at several places, but if you want the latest
  11.11 (alpha, but stable AFAIK) with no known issues concerning
  preview-latex, you can find it there as well.

* RPMs for preview-latex and AUC TeX are provided for users of RedHat
  Linux.  For the binary RPMs, you will need the preview-latex-common
  RPM as well as the Emacs-flavor specific RPM.

The RPMs require a few packages:

* GhostScript 6.51 is included in RH 7.2, but if you use an earlier
  release it can be downloaded from the RH7.2 updates,
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/updates/7.2/en/os/i386/>.
  The current beta of RedHat 7.3 (see below) includes GhostScript 6.53.

* Emacs-21.2 is part of the beta release for RedHat 7.3 at
  <URL:ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/beta/skipjack/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/>
  unless it has already been superceded by the regular release.
  I installed this using 'rpm -i --nodeps --force', which worked for
  me, but since it does not follow the usual emacs + emacs-X11 +
  emacs-nox, YMMV.
