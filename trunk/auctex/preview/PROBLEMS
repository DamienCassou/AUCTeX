Most of the problems encountered come from interaction with
GhostScript.  It is a good idea to have a fairly recent version of
GhostScript installed.  In particular, the device names have changed
over the time, so you should check that the devices demanded by the
customizable variable preview-image-creators fit your version of
GhostScript, at least the entry corresponding to the current value of
preview-image-type.  While not being best in file size and image
quality, setting preview-image-creators to `jpeg' should probably be
one of the best bets, since that device name has not changed in quite
some time.

If you want to try the direct Postscript rendering from Emacs by
setting preview-image-type to `postscript', Emacs-21.0.106
unfortunately has a bug that should be corrected as of the following
version.  Earlier versions are not affected (although versions earlier
than 21.0.105 are mostly unusable for internal EPS support).  Use the
following patch for 21.0.106:

AucTeX versions up to 10.0g have a bug in the calculation of the
offsets for the start of a region.  This affects C-c C-r commands
where the start of the region does not lie on the start of a line.  To
correct this, apply the following patch:

The CVS version of AucTeX is already fixed with regard to that
particular bug.

Current versions of x-symbol confuse the line parsing of
preview-LaTeX.  They also confuse that of Auc-TeX, but with less
glaring consequences.  A solution is being worked on, but this depends
on a few factors that will probably lead to some changed APIs in
AucTeX.
