** GhostScript failures

Most of the problems encountered come from interaction with
GhostScript.  It is a good idea to have a fairly recent version of
GhostScript installed.  In particular, the device names have changed
over the time, so you should check that the devices demanded by the
customizable variable preview-image-creators fit your version of
GhostScript, at least the entry corresponding to the current value of
preview-image-type.  While not being best in file size and image
quality, setting preview-image-creators to `jpeg' should probably be
one of the best bets, since that device name has not changed in quite
some time.

When GhostScript fails, the necessary information and messages from
Ghostscript go somewhere.  If GhostScript fails before starting to
process images, you'll find the information at the end of the process
buffer you can see with C-c C-l.  If GhostScript fails while
processing a particular image, this image will be tagged with
middle-clickable buttons for the error description and for the
corresponding source file.

The default options configurable with
M-x customize-variable RET preview-gs-options

include the options "-dTextAlphaBits=4" "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=4".
These options have been reported to make GhostScript 5.50 fail, but
are reported to work under GhostScript 6.51 and later.  If you are
experiencing problems, it might help to customize them away.  Of
course, this also takes away the joy of antialiasing, so upgrading
GhostScript might not be the worst idea after all.

** Various patches

Cut those out and pipe them through the patch program in the
appropriate directory.  Under Emacs, you can do this by first doing
M-x cd RET and then entering the directory in which the file to patch
resides, then marking the region in this file containing the patch and
doing M-| patch RET.

* Emacs-21.1 (don't use any earlier)

Should work mostly.

* AucTeX up to 10.0g

AucTeX versions up to 10.0g have a bug in the calculation of the
offsets for the start of a region.  This affects C-c C-r commands
where the start of the region does not lie on the start of a line.  To
correct this, apply the following patch (since I have edited around in
it, you'll get messages about offsets).

* x-symbol

Current versions of x-symbol confuse the line parsing of
preview-LaTeX.  They also confuse that of Auc-TeX, but with less
glaring consequences.  A solution is being worked on, but this depends
on a few factors that will probably lead to some changed APIs in
AucTeX.
