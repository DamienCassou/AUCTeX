These are the release notes for AUCTeX 11.50.

AUCTeX provides by far the most wide-spread and sophisticated
environment of editing LaTeX, TeX, ConTeXt and Texinfo documents using
Emacs and XEmacs, and when combined with packages like RefTeX,
preview-latex, flyspell and others, is pretty much without peer.  It
supports document-depending completion, syntax highlighting, easily
accessible menus, several different TeX distribution, jumping to error
locations in the source file, various shortcut, and intelligent
indentation and filling of the text while you enter it.

Documentation and interfaces in this release are still a moving
target, partly due to a lack of volunteers for non-programming tasks:
documentation writing, tutorials, translations, reference material,
sleuth work, testing.

Nevertheless, we strongly recommend using this release over the last
one: the number of bugs has quite decreased, and usability is
strikingly superior.

Notable new features:

PDFTeX is being supported with a new mode that can be toggled with C-c
C-t C-p, and the appropriate viewer gets selected depending on the
generated output file type.  Current versions of preview-latex will
respect AUCTeX's PDF mode.

Inverse and forward search work out of the box with viewers supporting
Source Specials.  Their use can be toggled with C-c C-t C-s and is
made more convenient by the new C-c C-v viewer shortcut.  For inverse
search, emacsclient or gnuclient are used if available.

Authors of LaTeX class and style files previously were not able to
make much use of AUCTeX.  Mostly due to the work of Ralf Angeli,
creating style files is supported with syntax highlighting, a highly
sophisticated completely rewritten engine for keeping indentation and
environments in .dtx files consistent in both documentation and code
sections, additional macro completions for programmer commands and a
few other goodies.

ConTeXt is a supported format now.

tex-fold.el is a new style file used for hiding away TeX constructs
like footnotes or references.

Syntax highlighting has become smarter and supports sub- and
superscripts.

The menus have been reorganized and cleaned up (and you'll see a few
changes and additions in keybindings there), and the Command menu will
now only offer commands relevant to the current major mode.

A new autoconf-based installation makes configuring and installing
AUCTeX a mostly automatic process, even under Windows.  Read the files
INSTALL or INSTALL.windows for instructions.

AUCTeX is proceeding as a GNU project with the long-term intent of
merging it into Emacs (and merging with preview-latex
<URL:http://preview-latex.sourceforge.net> probably next year).  All
new contributors need to assign copyright to their contributions to
the FSF (the usual procedure for Emacs contributors).  The same holds
for past contributors.  The principal authors and maintainers have
already done so, but it would require a diligent and diplomatic
volunteer to find and ask the rest.

You'll find more information at the web site of AUCTeX

address.
