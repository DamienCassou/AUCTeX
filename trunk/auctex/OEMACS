I few weeks ago, I asked here if anybody had a working TeX/LaTeX mode
for OEMACS (GNU Emacs 19.19 for MS-DOS). I wanted a TeX-mode, where it
was possible to call LaTeX, TeX and the dvi viewer without leaving
Emacs. The standard tex-mode.el does not work under DOS. I promised to
summarize my results: 
It was suggested, that I should use AUC TeX, since it should be
relatively easy to make it work under DOS. That turned out to be a
good idea.

AUC TeX is a much improved tex-mode, I recommend it for both DOS and
Unix users! It includes features such as error parsing, command
completion, outlining and a lot of other nice stuff, all very well
documented in the 70+ pages manual.

Here is a short description of how to make AUC TeX work for OEMACS:
(A similar method should work for DEMACS)

STEP 1. Install the files at your PC. You can obtain AUC TeX by
	anonymous ftp from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/emacs-lisp/auctex.tar.Z.

	Unpack the file, and transfer it to your PC preserving the
	directory structure. The files should
	be placed in a subdirectory called auctex under your site-lisp
	directory (or under another directory on your load-path).
	WARNING: When transferring the files, LF should be converted
	to CR/LF pairs. Most unix programs that can write MS-DOS
	diskettes have a "text mode" that does this. Some of them also
	add an End-Of-File marker (^Z) at the end of the files (just
	in case you are going to use it under MS-DOS ver. 1.X :-) ).
	This will prevent byte-compiling. You may have to delete the
	^Z characters manually.

STEP 2.	Edit the file tex-site.el:
	Set the variable TeX-lisp-directory to the directory where you
	placed AUC TeX, and TeX-macro-global to where you keep your
	.sty files:

(defvar TeX-lisp-directory "c:/emacs-19.19/site-lisp/auctex/"
  "*The directory where the AUC TeX lisp files are located.
The directory name *must* end with a slash.")
(defvar TeX-macro-global
  '("c:/emtex/texinput/")
  "*Directories containing the sites TeX macro files and style files.
The directory names *must* end with a slash.")
	
	Near the end of tex-site.el (around line 329) the variables
	TeX-shell and TeX-shell-command-option should be changed to
	reflect the MS-DOS environment: (Do NOT follow the
	instructions in the comments for DEMACS if you have OEMACS)

[[ This should not be necessary in version 8 --Per ]]

;;;;(defvar TeX-shell "/bin/sh"
(defvar TeX-shell shell-file-name
  "Name of shell used to parse TeX commands.")
;;;;(defvar TeX-shell-command-option "-c"
(defvar TeX-shell-command-option "/c"
  "Shell argument indicating that next argument is the command.")

	The list TeX-command-list should be updated. You will need to
	remove single quotes (') from the command arguments, since
	COMMAND.COM does not do that, and does not (mis-)interpret the
	argument. You will probably also need to update the View
	command (the variable windows-system is set to pc, ie. true)

(defvar TeX-command-list
  (list (list "TeX" "tex \\nonstopmode\\input %t" 'TeX-TeX-hook nil t)
	(list "LaTeX" "latex \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}" 'TeX-LaTeX-hook nil t)
	(list "SliTeX" "slitex \\nonstopmode\\input{%t}"
	      'TeX-LaTeX-hook nil t)  
	(if window-system
	    (list "View" "dviscr @scr.cnf %s " 'TeX-command-hook t nil)
	  (list "View" "dvi2tty -q -w 132 %s " 'TeX-command-hook t nil))

	If you are using emTeX, or another "international" LaTeX, that
	identifies itself as ILaTeX in stead of LaTeX, you should
	change a regexp in the file tex-buf.el (near line 506).
	Otherwise AUC TeX will report "LaTeX: problems" if LaTeX runs
	without errors, and believe you want to run LaTeX again before
	viewing the .dvi file.

[[ Fixed in version 8 --Per ]]

	((re-search-forward
;;;;	  "^\\(\\*\\* \\)?J?\\(La\\|Sli\\)TeX \\(Version\\|ver\\.\\)" nil t)
	  "^\\(\\*\\* \\)?J?I?\\(La\\|Sli\\)TeX \\(Version\\|ver\\.\\)" nil t)

STEP 3. [OPTIONAL, BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED]
	Byte-compile AUC TeX. Start Emacs from the auctex directory.
	Load the file lpath.el (Use M-x load-file). Byte-compile
	everything using the command 
	C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory RET RET
	Errors like "end of file while parsing top level" probably
	means that you have a ^Z character in the end of your file.

STEP 4.	Add the following line to your _emacs file
        (load-library "auctex/tex-site")
	
	You should also add the lines
	(setq tex-default-mode 'latex-mode)
	(setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) 

STEP 5. [OPTIONAL]
	Compile the LaCheck utility using your favourite C compiler.
	Look in the .../auctex/lacheck/makefile file to see what should be
	done. I have not tried this, but I cannot see any reasons why
	it should not work.

[[ You can ftp a DOS binary from ftp.iesd.auc.dk:/pub/TeX/LaTeX --Per ]]

STEP 6. [OPTIONAL]
	Print the manual (approx. 75 pages). The dvi file is in the
	doc directory. The manual is worth reading, AUC TeX can do
	things you wouldn't suspect you need :-)

The whole package will use 1.2 MB of your precious harddisk space ---
but it's worth it! You could of course compress / delete everything
except the .elc files (250 kB). I haven't tried this (yet), so I don't
know if it has disastrous side effects.

PROBLEMS: I have experienced the following problems:
1) If LaTeX, the dvi viewer etc. cannot find a file name, it will try
to read a name from the keyboard via stdin, and hang. C-break can
often save the day. My dvi viewer has no problems reading the keyboard
once it has started since it then uses direct keyboard reads.

2) When the dvi viewer terminates, it changes from graphics mode to 25
lines text mode. If Emacs was in 43 or 50 lines mode, the screen is
now in 25 lines mode, but Emacs believes there are 43 (50) lines!
