** min-map.el:  Minor Keymaps 

For authors of minor modes, who need to rebind one or more keys while
in the minor mode.  You can do this by hiding the old binding in a
variable, and then restore the binding when you leave the mode.
Unfortunately, this will usually not work if more than one minor mode
try to rebind the key.  You can solve this problem, by using the
following functions to bind keys in minor modes.  See the
documentation string for the individual functions for details.

Put in (require 'min-map) in the start of the file containing your
minor mode. 

Use minor-set-key to set a key in the minor keymap for a given minor
mode.

Use minor-call-shadow to call the key binding shadowed by a given
minor mode.

Use unbind-minor-mode to remove all key definitions for a given minor
mode.

** min-out.el:  Outline Minor Mode

Allows you to use the outline-mode commands while in another major
mode.  This is already integrated in LaTeX-mode.  You toggle the mode
with M-x outline-minor-mode.  If you want to support other major
modes, let them change the outline-regexp and outline-level-function.
outline-regexp matches header lines (by default lines starting with
one or more *'s), and outline-level-function calculate the level of
the header (by default the length of the string matched by
outline-regexp).

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'outline-minor-mode "min-out" "Toggle outline minor mode." t)
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-prefix-char)
(setq-default outline-prefix-char "\C-c\C-o") ; Change to get a better prefix
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-regexp)
(setq-default outline-regexp "[*\^l]+")
(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-level-function)
(setq-default outline-level-function 'outline-level-default)

** min-key.el:  Mapping the keyboard layout

This package allows you to specify a language specific keyboard
mapping between various encodings of an alphabet, and it also allows
you to convert the text in the buffer directly between the supported
encodings.

Currently the following languages / character set encodings are
supported: 

"Danish":
	"ISO 646 DK" "Keyboard Layout" "Digraphs" "TeX" "ISO 8859 Latin 1"

"Swedish":
	"ISO 646 SE" "Keyboard Layout" "Digraphs" "TeX" "ISO 8859 Latin 1"

"Keyboard Layout":
	"QWERTY" "Dvorak"

"ISO 8859 Latin 1":
	"ISO 8859 Latin 1" "Monograph" "Digraph" 
	"ISO 646" "RFC 1345" "Backspace" "TeX"

The keyboard remapping is implemented as a minor mode.  You initially
select the mapping with ``M-x keyboard-query-mapping'', and can then
toggle mode with ``M-x keyboard-mode''.  Once in the minor mode, you
can (optionally) get the original binding of a key by typing the the
key twice.

You convert between character sets by typing 
``M-x convert-character-query'', and answering the questions.  Use
`convert-character-encoding' to convert non-interactively. 

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'keyboard-mode "min-key" "Toggle keyboard-mode." t)
(autoload 'keyboard-query-mapping "min-key" "Query keyboard-mode." t)
(autoload 'convert-character-query "min-key" "Convert between encodings." t)
(autoload 'convert-character-encoding "min-key"
          "Convert between encodings." nil)

You most likely want to define a short-cut for often used mappings.
The following function redefine the keys on an international
keyboard to generate Danish characters as TeX macros.

(defun tex-dk-double-mode (arg)
  "DK TeX keys on international keyboard."
  (interactive "P")
  (require 'min-key)
  (if (or (and (null arg) keyboard-mode)
	  (<= (prefix-numeric-value arg) 0))
      (keyboard-mode -1)
    (keyboard-set-mapping "Danish" "Keyboard Layout" "TeX" t)
    (keyboard-mode 1)))

** min-ind.el:  Automatic indentation

Auto-indent mode works by invoking indent-relative for TAB, and using
indent-relative-maybe as the indent-line-function for auto-fill, and
NEWLINE. Enter and leave with M-x auto-indent-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'auto-indent-mode "min-ind" "Toggle auto-indent-mode." t)

** min-ispl.el: Automatic ispell of words

In auto-ispell-mode `space' or `return' automatically trigger
`ispell-word' on previously typed word.  M-TAB will make an ispell
completion. Enter and leave with M-x auto-ispell-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(autoload 'auto-ispell-mode "min-ispl" "Toggle auto-ispell-mode." t)

** ltx-dead.el: Accent's in LaTeX

Get TeX accent on letters by typing accent key followed by letter.
Enter and leave with M-x LaTeX-dead-mode.

To use, add to your init file:

(setq LaTeX-dead-keys '(?' ?` ?\" ?^ ?~)) ; Remove those you don't need
(autoload 'LaTeX-dead-mode "ltx-dead" "Toggle LaTeX-dead-mode." t)

** tex-math.el: Mathematical macros in TeX

Bind mathematical to backquote.  You enter mathematical macros with
` letter, e.g. ` a will insert \alpha in the buffer.

To use, add to your init file:

(setq LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix "`") ; Change if you like ` as is.
(autoload 'LaTeX-math-mode "tex-math" "Toggle math mode." t)

** For your init file.

(make-variable-buffer-local 'outline-regexp)
