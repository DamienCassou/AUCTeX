@itemize @bullet
@item
The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain @TeX{},
La@TeX{}, Con@TeX{}t etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
@code{TeX-command-menu} has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
and the customization will not work correctly.

@item
If @code{TeX-master} is set to @code{t}, AUC@TeX{} will now query for
a master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be
left alone.  The new function @code{TeX-master-file-ask} is provided
for adding the variable manually.

@item
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font.  The variable
@code{font-latex-title-fontity} can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

@item
Support for @code{paralist.sty} was added.

@item
AUC@TeX{} may now be customized to fontify either >>German<< or
<<French>> quotes by changing the variable @code{font-latex-quotes}.

@item
Certain @TeX{}/La@TeX{} function, reference, variable and warning
keywords will now be fontified.  Own keywords may be added by
customizing the variables @code{font-latex-match-function-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-reference-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-variable-keywords} and
@code{font-latex-match-warning-keywords}.

@item
FIXME: How can the changes in @code{german.el} and @code{ngerman.el}
regarding @code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-open-quote}, @code{LaTeX-german-close-quote} be
described?

@item
AUC@TeX{} now includes support for ConTeXt.

@item
AUC@TeX{} now is able to determine automatically which viewer to
choose and what parameters to pass to it by looking at the extension
of the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style}.

@item
@code{TeX-run-discard} is now able to completely detach a process that
it started.

@item
The build process was enhanced and is now based on @code{autoconf}.

@item
You can now switch between using the @file{font-latex} (all emacsen),
the @file{tex-font} (Emacs 21 only) or no special package for font
locking.  Customize @code{TeX-install-font-lock} for this.

@item
Now use @t{-t landscape} by default when landscape option appears.
Suggested by Erik Frisk <frisk@@isy.liu.se>.
