@item
The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain @TeX{},
La@TeX{}, Con@TeX{}t etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
@code{TeX-command-menu} has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
and the customization will not work correctly.

@item
You can now control if indentation is done upon typing @key{RET} by
customizing the variable @code{TeX-newline-function}.

@item
Limited support for @code{doc.sty} (@samp{dtx} files) was added.  The
new doc@TeX{} mode provides functionality for editing documentation
parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and filling), adding macros
and environments while staying in comments as well as syntax
highlighting.  Please note that the mode is by far not finished yet.
For example syntax highlighting does not work yet in XEmacs.

@item
Support for Con@TeX{}t with a separate Con@TeX{}t mode is now included.
Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and English.

@item
The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
available functionality and customization options are explained in the
manual.

@item
If @code{TeX-master} is set to @code{t}, AUC@TeX{} will now query for a
master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
alone.  The new function @code{TeX-master-file-ask} (bound to @kbd{C-c
_} is provided for adding the variable manually.

@item
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display devices
which support such fontification.  The variable
@code{font-latex-title-fontity} can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

@item
Support for @code{alphanum.sty}, @code{beamer.cls}, @code{booktabs.sty},
@code{emp.sty} and @code{paralist.sty} was added.  Credits go to the
authors mentioned in the respective AUC@TeX{} style files.

@item
The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for paragraphs
and regions respectively which do both.

@item
Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited by
either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the variable
@code{font-latex-quotes}.

@item
Certain @TeX{}/La@TeX{} keywords for functions, references, variables
and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
keywords by customizing the variables
@code{font-latex-match-function-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-reference-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-variable-keywords} and
@code{font-latex-match-warning-keywords}.

@item
If you include the style files @file{german} or @file{ngerman} in a
document (directly or via the @samp{babel} package), you should now
customize @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote} and
@code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote} instead of @code{TeX-open-quote},
@code{TeX-close-quote} and @code{TeX-quote-after-quote} if you want to
influence the type of quote insertion.

@item
Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line options
for it are now determined automatically by looking at the extension of
the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style}.

@item
@code{TeX-run-discard} is now able to completely detach a process that
it started.

@item
The build process was enhanced and is now based on @code{autoconf}.
